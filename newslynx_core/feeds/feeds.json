{"domain": "rss.nytimes.com", "meta_keywords": ["Nordhaus  William D", "Greenhouse Gas Emissions", "Nordhaus  Robert", "Global Warming"], "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In the New Mexico of the 1950s, the two brothers grew up steeped in the beauty of the landscape, the economics of energy and the power of science. They skied, fly-fished, explored on the family\u2019s 50,000-acre sheep ranch, watched oil towns go boom and bust, and talked of the nuclear weapons up the road at Los Alamos.\n\nToday the work of Robert and William Nordhaus is profoundly shaping how the United States and other nations take on global warming.\n\nBill Nordhaus, 72, a Yale economist who is seen as a leading contender for a Nobel Prize, came up with the idea of a carbon tax and effectively invented the economics of climate change. Bob, 77, a prominent Washington energy lawyer, wrote an obscure provision in the Clean Air Act of 1970 that is now the legal basis for a landmark climate change regulation, to be unveiled by the White House next month, that could close hundreds of coal-fired power plants and define President Obama\u2019s environmental legacy.\n\nCalled the Manning brothers of climate change, the mild-mannered, dry-witted Nordhauses are scions of a New Mexico family long rooted in the land, which powerfully shaped who the brothers became. But for the Nordhaus brothers, protecting the earth depends far more on dispassionate thinking and intellectual rigor than on showy protests outside the White House.\n\nThey have neatly divided their world \u2014 Bill is the academic theorist, Bob the legal mind and political pragmatist \u2014 but their work is intertwined.\n\n\u201cI tend to have lots of crazy ideas, and I run them by Bob first,\u201d Bill said by phone from the Acela train between Boston and New Haven, Conn. He described himself as \u201can academic economist\u201d who has stayed out of policy debates, although his ideas have not.\n\nBob agreed. \u201cBill\u2019s work is about what needs to be done and how soon, using the tools of economic analysis,\u201d he said over a recent lunch in Washington. \u201cMy work is: How do you convert that into a legal and regulatory policy?\u201d\n\nThe two have a friendly rivalry, but both believe that cutting carbon pollution is crucial to protecting the environment and the economy from the risks posed by climate change. They also agree on the best way to do it: A Bill-style carbon tax, they say, would be far more effective and efficient than a Bob-style regulation.\n\nTheir story starts in Albuquerque, where their father, the grandson of a wealthy Santa Fe merchant, started the ski resort at the top of Albuquerque\u2019s Sandia Peak and with a partner built the city\u2019s iconic tram up the granite cliffs to get there. A specialist in energy and Native American law, Robert Nordhaus Sr. won a Supreme Court case giving Apache tribes the authority to levy fees on the oil companies that drilled on their native land.\n\nLike him, both brothers went east to Yale, where in 1963 Bob graduated from the law school and Bill from Yale College. From there Bob headed to Washington for a job as a staff lawyer in the House legislative counsel\u2019s office.\n\nHe was still there in 1970, working on the bill that would become the Clean Air Act, when his bosses came to him with an unusual assignment: The legislation already included language to regulate known pollutants, such as mercury and smog, but could he write a provision giving the federal government the authority to regulate as-yet-unknown pollutants of the future?\n\nBob wrote the provision \u2014 it became Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act \u2014 at a time when carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, was not considered harmful. It was not until 2009 that the Environmental Protection Agency defined carbon dioxide as a harmful pollutant because of its contribution to global warming. Thus it falls into the category of an unknown \u201cpollutant of the future.\u201d Section 111(d), after languishing in obscurity for decades, is now the legal rationale for the Obama administration\u2019s plan to regulate carbon emissions without a law passed by Congress.\n\nWhile Bob began his career in Washington, Bill received a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and began teaching at Yale. By the late 1970s, when an increasing number of scientists were raising the threat of global warming, Bill wrote a paper proposing a tax on industries and businesses based on the amount of carbon they emitted into the air. The idea was revolutionary at the time, but economists, scientists and many world leaders now say it will have a powerful market effect and is the best way to stave off the catastrophic impacts of a warming world. Already, more than 30 countries have passed carbon-pricing laws.\n\nIn the ensuing decades at Yale, Bill developed an economic model that put a price tag on the effects of climate change, like more droughts, flooding and crop failures and stronger hurricanes. He called it the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model, or DICE.\n\n\u201cThe name was both descriptive (representing a dynamic integrated model of climate and the economy) but also consciously aimed to suggest that we are gambling with the future of our planet,\u201d Bill wrote in an email.\n\nDICE profoundly changed climate policy. Although the chief political argument against curbing carbon emissions from cars and coal plants has long been that doing so would harm the economy, the DICE models show that, depending on various scenarios, one ton of carbon pollution can inflict $20 to $30 in economic damage \u2014 a major cost, given that the global economy emits about 36 billion tons of carbon a year.\n\nBill\u2019s work \u201cwas seminal,\u201d said Robert Stavins, director of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program.\n\nBut it is, for the time being, politically untenable in the United States. The conservative Heritage Foundation has called the DICE model \u201cflawed beyond use for policy making\u201d and warned that it should not be used to justify \u201ctrillions of dollars of government policies and burdensome regulations.\u201d\n\nHere the work of Bob comes in: Mr. Obama tried but failed to push a carbon-pricing bill through Congress in his first term, which is why he has turned to Bob\u2019s section of the Clean Air Act as the legal underpinning for the regulation due out in June.\n\nBob, who was an energy adviser to President Jimmy Carter and general counsel at the Department of Energy under President Bill Clinton, now says that because he was not writing the provision with climate change in mind, the new regulation is an imperfect and perhaps legally vulnerable solution to regulating carbon pollution. Environmental lawyers note that it has almost never been used.\n\n\u201cI call it the 40-year-old virgin,\u201d said David Doniger, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group.\n\nBut one way the E.P.A. will justify the new regulation is with an analysis showing that the economic benefits of the climate change rule would outweigh the costs.\n\nA core component of that analysis? The DICE model.\n\nBack in New Mexico, Bob recalled, he and Bill \u2014 the oldest and youngest brothers among four siblings \u2014 could not help noticing the changing world of energy around them. In the 1950s, he said, as the Los Alamos weapons program expanded, the state changed \u201cfrom a pastoral economy, split between ranching, irrigated farming and extractive industries, to defense-related work, which was a whole different world.\u201d\n\nThey also paid close attention to the climate changes, and periodic droughts, that affected the family ski business and their lives outdoors.\n\n\u201cGrowing up in New Mexico,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re aware of the very fragile ecosystem.\u201d", "image": null, "pub_datetime": "2014-05-10T18:59:21", "keywords": ["climate",

steeped in the beauty of the landscape, the economics of energy and the power of science. They skied, fly-fished, explored on the family&#8217;s 50,000-acre sheep ranch, watched oil towns go boom and bust, and talked of the nuclear weapons up the road at Los Alamos.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Today the work of Robert and William Nordhaus is profoundly shaping how the United States and other nations take on global warming.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Bill Nordhaus, 72, a Yale economist who is seen as a leading contender for a Nobel Prize, came up with the idea of a carbon tax and effectively invented the economics of climate change. Bob, 77, a prominent Washington energy lawyer, wrote an obscure provision in the <a title=\"E.P.A. summary.\" href=\"http://www2.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-air-act\">Clean Air Act of 1970</a> that is now the legal basis for a landmark climate change regulation, <a title=\"Times article, May 8, 2014.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/09/us/politics/obama-to-give-push-on-climate.html?hpw&amp;rref=politics\">to be unveiled by the White House</a> next month, that could close hundreds of coal-fired power plants and define President Obama&#8217;s environmental legacy.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-5\">Called the Manning brothers of climate change, the mild-mannered, dry-witted Nordhauses are scions of a New Mexico family long rooted in the land, which powerfully shaped who the brothers became. But for the Nordhaus brothers, protecting the earth depends far more on dispassionate thinking and intellectual rigor than on showy protests outside the White House.</p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">They have neatly divided their world &#8212; Bill is the academic theorist, Bob the legal mind and political pragmatist &#8212; but their work is intertwined.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;I tend to have lots of crazy ideas, and I run them by Bob first,&#8221; Bill said by phone from the Acela train between Boston and New Haven, Conn. He described himself as &#8220;an academic economist&#8221; who has stayed out of policy debates, although his ideas have not.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Bob agreed. &#8220;Bill&#8217;s work is about what needs to be done and how soon, using the tools of economic analysis,&#8221; he said over a recent lunch in Washington. &#8220;My work is: How do you convert that into a legal and regulatory policy?&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-2\">The two have a friendly rivalry, but both believe that cutting carbon pollution is crucial to protecting the environment and the economy from the risks posed by climate change. They also agree on the best way to do it: A Bill-style carbon tax, they say, would be far more effective and efficient than a Bob-style regulation.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Their story starts in Albuquerque, where their father, the grandson of a wealthy Santa Fe merchant, started the ski resort at the top of Albuquerque&#8217;s Sandia Peak and with a partner built the city&#8217;s iconic tram up the granite cliffs to get there. A specialist in energy and Native American law, Robert Nordhaus Sr. <a title=\"Times article, Jan. 26, 1982.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/26/business/high-court-says-indian-tribes-can-tax-extracted-minerals.html?action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults&amp;mabReward=relbias&amp;\">won a Supreme Court case</a> giving Apache tribes the authority to levy fees on the oil companies that drilled on their native land.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Like him, both brothers went east to Yale, where in 1963 Bob graduated from the law school and Bill from Yale College. From there Bob headed to Washington for a job as a staff lawyer in the House legislative counsel&#8217;s office.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">He was still there in 1970, working on the bill that would become the Clean Air Act, when his bosses came to him with an unusual assignment: The legislation already included language to regulate known pollutants, such as mercury and smog, but could he write a provision giving the federal government the authority to regulate as-yet-unknown pollutants of the future?</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-3\">Bob wrote the provision &#8212; it became Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act &#8212; at a time when carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, was not considered harmful. It was not until 2009 that the Environmental Protection Agency <a title=\"Times article, April 22, 2009.\" href=\"http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/co2-pollution-now-what/\">defined carbon dioxide as a harmful pollutant</a> because of its contribution to global warming. Thus it falls into the category of an unknown &#8220;pollutant of the future.&#8221; Section 111(d), after languishing in obscurity for decades, is now the legal rationale for the Obama administration&#8217;s plan to regulate carbon emissions without a law passed by Congress.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">While Bob began his career in Washington, Bill received a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and began teaching at Yale. By the late 1970s, when an increasing number of scientists were raising the threat of global warming, Bill wrote a paper proposing a tax on industries and businesses based on the amount of carbon they emitted into the air. The idea was revolutionary at the time, but economists, scientists and many world leaders now say it will have a powerful market effect and is the best way to stave off the catastrophic impacts of a warming world.

He called it the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model, or <a title=\"DICE 2013 introduction and manual, pdf.\" href=\"http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/documents/DICE_Manual_100413r1.pdf\">DICE</a>.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;The name was both descriptive (representing a dynamic integrated model of climate and the economy) but also consciously aimed to suggest that we are gambling with the future of our planet,&#8221; Bill wrote in an email.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">DICE profoundly changed climate policy. Although the chief political argument against curbing carbon emissions from cars and coal plants has long been that doing so would harm the economy, the DICE models show that, depending on various scenarios, one ton of carbon pollution can inflict $20 to $30 in economic damage &#8212; a major cost, given that the global economy emits about 36 billion tons of carbon a year.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Bill&#8217;s work &#8220;was seminal,&#8221; said Robert Stavins, director of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-4\">But it is, for the time being, politically untenable in the United States.

And while there are many theories, no one has been able to prove one.\n\nIn a modest public health clinic behind a gas station here in South Africa\u2019s rural KwaZulu/Natal Province, a team of Norwegian infectious disease specialists think they may have found a new explanation.\n\nIt is far too soon to say whether they are right. But even skeptics say the explanation is biologically plausible. And if it is proved correct, a low-cost solution has the potential to prevent thousands of infections every year.\n\nThe Norwegian team believes that African women are more vulnerable to H.I.V. because of a chronic, undiagnosed parasitic disease: genital schistosomiasis (pronounced shis-to-so-MY-a-sis), often nicknamed \u201cschisto.\u201d\n\nThe disease, also known as bilharzia and snail fever, is caused by parasitic worms picked up in infested river water. It is marked by fragile sores in the far reaches of the vaginal canal that may serve as entry points for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Dr. Eyrun F. Kjetland, who leads the Otimati team, says that it is more common than syphilis or herpes, which can also open the way for H.I.V.\n\nAlso, the foreign bodies in the sores \u2014 the worms and eggs \u2014 attract CD4 cells, the immune system\u2019s sentinels, and those are the very cells that H.I.V. attacks.\n\nThe worms can be killed by a drug that costs as little as 8 cents a pill. Dr. Kjetland\u2019s team is trying to determine whether that will heal the sores in young women.\n\nSome prominent AIDS experts doubt the schistosomiasis theory, pointing out, for example, that urban women raised far from infested water also die of AIDS. But proponents of the theory say that two decades ago, many experts were just as skeptical of the idea that circumcision protected men against H.I.V. It was not until 2006 that three clinical trials proved it correct.\n\nSchistosomiasis \u201cis arguably the most important cofactor in Africa\u2019s AIDS epidemic,\u201d said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a huge women\u2019s health issue: Everyone has heard of genital mutilation and obstetric fistulas. But mention this, and the headlights just go dim.\u201d\n\nThe idea is slowly gaining ground. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the United Nations, the National Institutes of Health, and the Danish and Norwegian governments have all given some grant support. But leaders of the two agencies that pay for the fight against global AIDS want more evidence before diverting funds from their campaigns for condoms, drugs and circumcision.\n\n\u201cWe need to track all these things down and see what\u2019s a cause and what\u2019s just another disease you have at the same time, like cervical cancer,\u201d said Dr. Mark R. Dybul, executive director of one of the agencies, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\n\nDr. Eric Goosby, who recently finished a five-year stint as coordinator of the other agency, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar, agreed that vaginal sores could help the virus enter. \u201cBut it\u2019s complicated,\u201d he added. \u201cA lot of women who have H.I.V. don\u2019t have schisto, and vice versa.\u201d\n\nFrom her small clinic just off the highway here, Dr. Kjetland makes visits to high schools where she has government permission to work because their communities have the highest rates of schistosomiasis. On the dirt roads around these hills, it can take her hours to reach each one.\n\nThrough school nurses, she gives deworming drugs to all students, male and female. (To her frustration, although the drug is sold by generic makers for as little as eight cents a pill, South African patent laws permit only the Bayer version, which costs $4.)\n\nThen she meets with groups of girls ages 16 and up to ask the sexually active ones to come to Otimati for gynecological exams and blood tests.\n\n\u201cI am as gentle as I can be, much more gentle than sex is for them,\u201d she said, \u201cbut even the slightest touch and they bleed.\u201d\n\nGentleness is part of Dr. Kjetland\u2019s nature. A 49-year-old stepmother of five, she watches like a mother over the girls in her study. She ordered that extra rooms be built where they can cry if they test positive for H.I.V. She tries to make sure the boys in their schools never realize she chooses only sexually active girls. And she has KFC delivered, since it is a treat for girls who often have only cornmeal mush to eat for days on end.\n\nThough trained in Norway, she has spent most of her life in Africa, growing up in Tanzania as the eldest of a missionary couple\u2019s six children, attending prep school in South Africa, and, after college and medical school in Norway, doing graduate work in Malawi and Zimbabwe.\n\nAn estimated 200 million Africans have had schistosomiasis. Although it is rarely fatal, the bleeding it causes in children can lead to anemia, stunted growth and learning problems. It is caused by tiny worms that live in freshwater snails and emerge with pointed heads that can penetrate the skin of people collecting water or washing clothes.\n\nOnce inside, the worms mate, with the female living in a cleft in the male\u2019s body \u201clike a hot dog in a bun,\u201d Dr. Kjetland said. Most nest in the urinary tract \u2014 bloody urine is the classic symptom \u2014 but a portion end up in the vagina, creating \u201csandy patches\u201d of damaged tissue and calcified eggs.\n\nStudies by Dr. Kjetland in Zimbabwe and South Africa and by Dr. Jennifer A. Downs of Weill Cornell Medical College in Tanzania have shown that women with the patches are about three times as likely as their neighbors to be infected with H.I.V.\n\nA gold standard study to prove the connection would be both impractical and unethical: Researchers would have to divide hundreds of infant girls into two groups, give half deworming drugs and half placebos, wait until they were perhaps 20 years old, and see how many had H.I.V. No ethics board would approve placebos under those conditions.\n\nSo Dr. Kjetland studies teenagers, hoping to heal their sores and see if their H.I.V. infection rates are lower than the norm. (In grown women, the sores persist even after the worms die.)\n\nFor years, theories have abounded as to why African women become infected with H.I.V.: for example, that they are more likely to have overlapping sexual partners \u2014 not always by choice \u2014 while women elsewhere have boyfriends or husbands in series. That rape, incest and domestic violence are rife in southern Africa, where the AIDS epidemic is worst. That syphilis and herpes are rampant. That impoverished, fatherless young women are forced to pay with sex for food, clothes, grades and even car rides.\n\nThe schisto hypothesis can now be added to that list, but to some prominent experts it remains unlikely.\n\nOne is Daniel Halperin, an epidemiologist now at the Ponce School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Puerto Rico. He knows how it feels to be doubted: In the 1990s, he was the chief proponent of the theory that circumcision protected men against H.I.V.\n\nHe argues that tropical West Africa, where schisto is common, has little H.I.V., while countries with little schisto, like arid Botswana and mountainous Swaziland, have sky-high H.I.V. rates.\n\nDr. Salim Abdool Karim, a renowned South African AIDS researcher who admires Dr. Kjetland\u2019s work, is also skeptical. His team follows more than 1,000 women in an area only 40 miles from Otimati with equally high H.I.V. rates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve studied genital tracts in detail for 20 years, photographing them sequentially,\u201d he said, \u201cand we see no sandy patches.\u201d\n\nUpon hearing that, Dr. Kjetland reached for the mounted magnifying scope she uses to examine girls.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not looking in the right places,\u201d she said.\n\nMost gynecologists, she explained, are trained to look for cancer, which usually starts near the center of the cervix, while sandy patches are tucked away in crevices that can be seen only by swinging the scope to extreme angles. It takes her weeks to train doctors to find them consistently, she said.\n\nFighting schisto across Africa would take an extensive pill-distribution effort, but Dr. Hotez, the Baylor dean, argues that it is worth it.\n\nSeventy million African children could be dewormed twice a year for 10 years at a cost of $112 million, he said in an essay titled \u201cAfrica\u2019s 32 Cents Solution for H.I.V./AIDS\u201d (32 cents being the cost of two generic deworming pills twice a year). That is cheap compared with the $38 billion Pepfar is expected to spend on AIDS in that period, he said.\n\nA vaccine would be even better, and several are in development, including one at the Sabin Vaccine Institute, which Dr. Hotez also heads.\n\nBut even if one works, \u201cit will be at least five to 10 years before the testing is finished,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t wait for that.\u201d", "image": null, "pub_datetime": "2014-05-10T16:28:30", "keywords": ["school", "theory", "hiv", "simple", "sores", "africa", "worms", "kjetland", "aids", "proposal", "dr", "south",

href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/aids/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about AIDS/H.I.V..\" class=\"meta-classifier\">AIDS</a> victims are men, Africa has long been the glaring exception: <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gender/hiv_aids/en/\">Nearly 60 percent</a> are women. And while there are many theories, no one has been able to prove one.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In a modest public health clinic behind a gas station here in South Africa&#8217;s rural KwaZulu/Natal Province, a team of Norwegian infectious disease specialists think they may have found a new explanation.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">It is far too soon to say whether they are right. But even skeptics say the explanation is biologically plausible. And if it is proved correct, a low-cost solution has the potential to prevent thousands of infections every year.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The Norwegian team believes that African women are more vulnerable to H.I.V. because of a chronic, undiagnosed parasitic disease: genital <a title=\"C.D.C. schistosomiasis page\" href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/schistosomiasis/\">schistosomiasis</a> (pronounced shis-to-so-MY-a-sis), often nicknamed &#8220;schisto.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The disease, also known as <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/schistosomiasis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Schistosomiasis.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">bilharzia</a> and snail <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/fever/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Fever.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">fever</a>, is caused by parasitic worms picked up in infested river water. It is marked by fragile sores in the far reaches of the vaginal canal that may serve as entry points for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Dr. Eyrun F. Kjetland, who leads the Otimati team, says that it is more common than <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/syphilis-primary/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Syphilis - primary.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">syphilis</a> or <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/herpes-simplex/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Herpes Virus.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">herpes</a>, which can also open the way for H.I.V.</p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-5\">Also, the foreign bodies in the sores &#8212; the worms and eggs &#8212; attract CD4 cells, the immune system&#8217;s sentinels, and those are the very cells that H.I.V. attacks.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The worms can be killed by a drug that costs as little as 8 cents a pill. Dr. Kjetland&#8217;s team is trying to determine whether that will heal the sores in young women.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Some prominent AIDS experts doubt the schistosomiasis theory, pointing out, for example, that urban women raised far from infested water also die of AIDS. But proponents of the theory say that two decades ago, many experts were just as skeptical of the idea that <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/surgery/circumcision/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Circumcision.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">circumcision</a> protected men against H.I.V. It was not until 2006 that three clinical trials <a title=\"Times article.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/14/health/14hiv.html\">proved it correct</a>.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-2\">Schistosomiasis &#8220;is arguably the most important cofactor in Africa&#8217;s AIDS epidemic,&#8221; said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. &#8220;And it&#8217;s a huge women&#8217;s health issue: Everyone has heard of genital mutilation and obstetric fistulas. But mention this, and the headlights just go dim.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The idea is slowly gaining ground. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the United Nations, the National Institutes of Health, and the Danish and Norwegian governments have all given some grant support. But leaders of the two agencies that pay for the fight against global AIDS want more evidence before diverting funds from their campaigns for <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/condoms/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"Recent and archival health news about condoms.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">condoms</a>, drugs and circumcision.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;We need to track all these things down and see what&#8217;s a cause and what&#8217;s just another disease you have at the same time, like <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cervical-cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Cervical Cancer.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">cervical cancer</a>,&#8221; said Dr. Mark R. Dybul, executive director of one of the agencies, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Dr. Eric Goosby, who recently finished a five-year stint as coordinator of the other agency, the <a href=\"http://www.pepfar.gov/\">President&#8217;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief</a>, or Pepfar, agreed that vaginal sores could help the virus enter. &#8220;But it&#8217;s complicated,&#8221; he added. &#8220;A lot of women who have H.I.V. don&#8217;t have schisto, and vice versa.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-3\">From her small clinic just off the highway here, Dr. Kjetland makes visits to high schools where she has government permission to work because their communities have the highest rates of schistosomiasis. On the dirt roads around these hills, it can take her hours to reach each one.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Through school nurses, she gives deworming drugs to all students, male and female. (To her frustration, although the drug is sold by generic makers for as little as eight cents a pill, South African patent laws permit only the Bayer version, which costs $4.)</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Then she meets with groups of girls ages 16 and up to ask the sexually active ones to come to Otimati for gynecological exams and blood tests.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;I am as gentle as I can be, much more gentle than sex is for them,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but even the slightest touch and they bleed.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Gentleness is part of Dr. Kjetland&#8217;s nature. A 49-year-old stepmother of five, she watches like a mother over the girls in her study. She ordered that extra rooms be built where they can cry if they test positive for H.I.V. She tries to make sure the boys in their schools never realize she chooses only sexually active girls. And she has KFC delivered, since it is a treat for girls who often have only cornmeal mush to eat for days on end.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Though trained in Norway, she has spent most of her life in Africa, growing up in Tanzania as the eldest of a missionary couple&#8217;s six children, attending prep school in South Africa, and, after college and medical school in Norway, doing graduate work in Malawi and Zimbabwe.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">An estimated 200 million Africans have had schistosomiasis. Although it is rarely fatal, the bleeding it causes in children can lead to <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/anemia/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Anemia.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">anemia</a>, stunted growth and learning problems. It is caused by tiny worms that live in freshwater snails and <a title=\"Discovery Channel schistosomiasis video\" href=\"http://www.discoveryfitandhealth.com/tv-shows/specials/videos/monsters-inside-me-schistosomiasis.htm\">emerge</a> with pointed heads that can penetrate the skin of people collecting water or washing clothes.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Once inside, the worms mate, with the female living in a cleft in the male&#8217;s body &#8220;like a hot dog in a bun,&#8221; Dr. Kjetland said. Most nest in the urinary tract &#8212; <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/urine-bloody/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Urine - bloody .\" class=\"meta-classifier\">bloody urine</a> is the classic symptom &#8212; but a portion end up in the vagina, creating &#8220;sandy patches&#8221; of damaged tissue and calcified eggs.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Studies by Dr. Kjetland in Zimbabwe and South Africa and by Dr. Jennifer A. Downs of Weill Cornell Medical College in Tanzania have shown that women with the patches are about <a title=\"Abstract of study by Dr. Kjetland\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16470124\">three times as likely</a> as their neighbors <a title=\"Abstract of Dr. Downs&#8217; study\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23033399\">to be infected</a> with H.I.V.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">A gold standard study to prove the connection would be both impractical and unethical: Researchers would have to divide hundreds of infant girls into two groups, give half deworming drugs and half placebos, wait until they were perhaps 20 years old, and see how many had H.I.V. No ethics board would approve placebos under those conditions.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">So Dr. Kjetland studies teenagers, hoping to heal their sores and see if their H.I.V. infection rates are lower than the norm. (In grown women, the sores persist even after the worms die.)</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">For years, theories have abounded as to why African women become infected with H.I.V.: for example, that they are more likely to have overlapping sexual partners &#8212; not always by choice &#8212; while women elsewhere have boyfriends or husbands in series. That rape, incest and domestic violence are rife in southern Africa, where the AIDS epidemic is worst. That syphilis and herpes are rampant. That impoverished, fatherless young women are forced to pay with sex for food, clothes, grades and even car rides.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The schisto hypothesis can now be added to that list, but to some prominent experts it remains unlikely.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">One is Daniel Halperin, an epidemiologist now at the Ponce School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Puerto Rico. He knows how it feels to be doubted: In the 1990s, he was the chief proponent of the theory that circumcision protected men against H.I.V.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-4\">He argues that tropical West Africa, where schisto is common, has little H.I.V., while countries with little schisto, like arid Botswana and mountainous Swaziland, have sky-high H.I.V. rates.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, a renowned South African AIDS researcher who admires Dr. Kjetland&#8217;s work, is also skeptical. His team follows more than 1,000 women in an area only 40 miles from Otimati with equally high H.I.V. rates.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;We&#8217;ve studied genital tracts in detail for 20 years, photographing them sequentially,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and we see no sandy patches.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Upon hearing that, Dr. Kjetland reached for the mounted magnifying scope she uses to examine girls.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;They&#8217;re not looking in the right places,&#8221; she said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Most gynecologists, she explained, are trained to look for <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Cancer.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">cancer</a>, which usually starts near the center of the cervix, while sandy patches are tucked away in crevices that can be seen only by swinging the scope to extreme angles. It takes her weeks to train doctors to find them consistently, she said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Fighting schisto across Africa would take an extensive pill-distribution effort, but Dr. Hotez, the Baylor dean, argues that it is worth it.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Seventy million African children could be dewormed twice a year for 10 years at a cost of $112 million, he said in <a href=\"http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0000430\">an essay</a> titled &#8220;Africa&#8217;s 32 Cents Solution for H.I.V./AIDS&#8221; (32 cents being the cost of two generic deworming pills twice a year). That is cheap compared with the $38 billion Pepfar is expected to spend on AIDS in that period, he said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">A vaccine would be even better, and <a title=\"Paper describing vaccine candidates\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK62497/\">several </a> are in development, including one at the <a href=\"http://www.sabin.org/\">Sabin Vaccine Institute</a>, which Dr. Hotez also heads.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">But even if one works, &#8220;it will be at least five to 10 years before the testing is finished,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We shouldn&#8217;t wait for that.&#8221;</p>    \n     \n\n                 \n      \n</div>", "meta_favicon": "http://static01.nyt.com/favicon.ico", "movies": [], "updated_dateime": "2014-05-11T02:49:24", "source_id": null}
{"domain": "rss.nytimes.com", "meta_keywords": ["Prospect Park (Brooklyn NY)"], "text": "Pete Dunne and Benjamin Van Doren are devout birders who share a passion for identifying rare species, recording their sightings and competing in birding events known as Big Days.\n\nBut as they prepared for the biggest Big Day of all, Saturday\u2019s World Series of Birding in New Jersey, their technological approaches could hardly be more disparate.\n\nMr. Van Doren, 20, a sophomore at Cornell, has a $2,500 camera setup, and an iPhone stocked with digital field guides, apps that play recordings of bird songs and help him, with GPS, home in on where he might find certain species.\n\nMr. Dunne, 62, has been preparing a bit differently. He refuses to bring a camera and keeps his cellphone turned off. He eschews birding apps and digital libraries in favor of the handwritten journal that he has kept since he was 7. The proliferation of digital photography and other technology changes the whole dynamic of birding, he said, \u201cgetting away from the art of field identification.\u201d\n\nIt was all leading to a regrettable mind-set, he added, of \u201cShoot first and identify later.\u201d\n\nNot long after professional baseball came around to instant replay, the booming world of competitive birding, once seen as a refuge from the clatter of the modern world, is now debating how much it should embrace technology. It is as close as birding, long proud of its honor system, has ever come to an identity crisis, particularly over the issue of whether photography should be required to prove a spotting. In debates among birders, the encroachment of smartphones and digital cameras has become inseparable from another touchy issue, the matter of questionable sightings, known as stringing.\n\nThe World Series is held every May throughout New Jersey, a major migration stop for birds heading north, and the event routinely attracts roughly 1,000 of the world\u2019s top birders, who will race around the state from midnight to midnight, often in four-member teams, trying to identify as many species as they can by sight or sound. Their reward will be bragging rights and the Urner-Stone Cup, which resembles a miniature version of hockey\u2019s Stanley Cup, though there are no cash prizes.\n\nThe competition, which also raises money for conservation, does not require photo evidence, and scoring remains on the honor system, though contestants who claim to have seen or heard rare birds can expect to be questioned by other teams about details. The rules do not allow the use of digital gadgets in the spotting or hearing of birds. Recorded calls cannot be played in the open, where they could inadvertently \u2014 or intentionally \u2014 induce birds to respond, for example. But birders are permitted to refresh themselves \u2014 in their cars, only \u2014 with recorded bird calls.\n\nThe pro-tech camp argues that it is silly to prohibit tools that educate birders, make birding more welcoming for novices, and build popular support for saving bird habitats.\n\n\u201cIt is bringing a new breath of air into the competitions,\u201d said Scott Whittle, a commercial photographer from Cape May, N.J., who has a $10,000 photo setup. He is also helping develop an app called Bird Genie that recognizes and identifies bird calls in the field.\n\nHe said he began birding six years ago and photographed his sightings \u201cbecause I knew I wasn\u2019t a good enough birder for people to trust me.\u201d\n\nThe verification of sightings and combating stringing \u2014 arguable sightings by inexperienced, overeager or simply cheating birders \u2014 is one of birding\u2019s most pressing issues and is the main argument for the use of photos.\n\nBirding\u2019s popularity, fueled in part by the recent films, \u201cThe Big Year,\u201d and \u201cA Birder\u2019s Guide to Everything,\u201d is approaching an extreme-sport level, with adrenaline-pumped teams putting in sleepless days.\n\nThe American Birding Association has begun discussions to revise portions of its code of ethics, said Jeffrey Gordon, the association\u2019s president. The code serves as a guideline for birders, though competition organizers are free to make their own rules. Mr. Gordon said that what little there was in the code regarding technology \u2014 there is a mention, for example, of curbing the use of \u201ctape recorders\u201d \u2014 has likely gone unchanged since being established a decade ago, \u201cbefore people were walking around with libraries of bird songs in their pocket.\u201d\n\nWhile the honor system remains paramount, Mr. Gordon said, photographs, provided they have not been altered, can offer \u201ca higher standard of evidence,\u201d especially for rare sightings, and for newer birders who have yet to establish reputations of being rock-solid in their identifications.\n\n\u201cI hear young birders joking around saying, \u2018Photos or it didn\u2019t happen,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cThe expectation is that if you report something rare, you\u2019re going to need a photograph. And I only see that increasing.\u201d\n\nThe association created a new category of competition: Photo Big Days. Last month, Mr. Whittle and Tom Stephenson, a Brooklyn-based birder who leads tours in Prospect Park, organized a Photo Big Day in Texas, and competed as well, photographing 209 birds in 24 hours, which the birding association has recognized as a record for North America.\n\nEven purists like Mr. Dunne, a New Jersey Audubon Society official who founded the World Series, said any tool that made birding more accessible was welcome. But introducing them to competitions goes against the trust implicit in birding, the purists said, and turns what should be a contest of devotion and skill into a free-for-all where tech wizardry and expensive cameras become the de facto entry requirements.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a pivotal time,\u201d Mr. Dunne said, acknowledging that birding technology was \u201cgoing to change birding dramatically and probably permanently.\u201d\n\nDrew Weber, who writes a blog about birding and technology at NemesisBird.com and helps develop birding apps, said he has heard some resentment among old guard birders toward tech-savvy ones who have gained vast birding knowledge with comparably little time spent in the field.\n\n\u201cA lot of traditional birders, honing their skills for decades, had to put all this time in, and they might see technology as a shortcut,\u201d he said.\n\nTeams in the World Series recruit members who can identify bird calls and can scout where targeted species are likely to be seen. To prepare for the event, Mr. Van Doren\u2019s Cornell team has spent a week driving around New Jersey using apps to log where specific birds had been spotted. They are not allowed to use apps to acquire new information during the event, but they can use them to refer to previously gathered information.\n\nMr. Van Doren acknowledged that technology should have its limits. The day will come, he predicted, when binoculars themselves will be able to identify birds. \u201cThat would be lame from a birding perspective,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it would take the skill out of it.\u201d", "image": null, "pub_datetime": "2014-05-10T14:33:58", "keywords": ["birdwatchers", "clash", "big", "apps", "sightings", "bird", "gadgets", "vs", "birds", "mr", "birding", "world",

"article_html": "<div><p class=\"story-body-text\">Pete Dunne and Benjamin Van Doren are devout birders who share a passion for identifying rare species, recording their sightings and competing in birding events known as Big Days.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">But as they prepared for the biggest Big Day of all, Saturday&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.njaudubon.org/SectionWorldSeriesofBirding/WorldSeriesofBirding.aspx\">World Series of Birding</a> in New Jersey, their technological approaches could hardly be more disparate.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Mr. Van Doren, 20, a sophomore at Cornell, has a $2,500 camera setup, and an iPhone stocked with digital field guides, apps that play recordings of bird songs and help him, with GPS, home in on where he might find certain species.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Mr. Dunne, 62, has been preparing a bit differently. He refuses to bring a camera and keeps his cellphone turned off. He eschews birding apps and digital libraries in favor of the handwritten journal that he has kept since he was 7. The proliferation of digital photography and other technology changes the whole dynamic of birding, he said, &#8220;getting away from the art of field identification.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">It was all leading to a regrettable mind-set, he added, of &#8220;Shoot first and identify later.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Not long after professional baseball came around to instant replay, the booming world of competitive birding, once seen as a refuge from the clatter of the modern world, is now debating how much it should embrace technology. It is as close as birding, long proud of its honor system, has ever come to an identity crisis, particularly over the issue of whether photography should be required to prove a spotting. In debates among birders, the encroachment of smartphones and digital cameras has become inseparable from another touchy issue, the matter of questionable sightings, known as stringing.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The World Series is held every May throughout New Jersey, a major migration stop for birds heading north, and the event routinely attracts roughly 1,000 of the world&#8217;s top birders, who will race around the state from midnight to midnight, often in four-member teams, trying to identify as many species as they can by sight or sound. Their reward will be bragging rights and the <a href=\"http://nikondvoc.blogspot.com/2010/05/urner-stone-cup.html\">Urner-Stone Cup</a>, which resembles a miniature version of hockey&#8217;s Stanley Cup, though there are no cash prizes.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The competition, which also raises money for conservation, does not require photo evidence, and scoring remains on the honor system, though contestants who claim to have seen or heard rare birds can expect to be questioned by other teams about details. The rules do not allow the use of digital gadgets in the spotting or hearing of birds. Recorded calls cannot be played in the open, where they could inadvertently &#8212; or intentionally &#8212; induce birds to respond, for example. But birders are permitted to refresh themselves &#8212; in their cars, only &#8212; with recorded bird calls.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The pro-tech camp argues that it is silly to prohibit tools that educate birders, make birding more welcoming for novices, and build popular support for saving bird habitats.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">&#8220;It is bringing a new breath of air into the competitions,&#8221; said Scott Whittle, a commercial photographer from Cape May, N.J., who has a $10,000 photo setup. He is also helping develop an app called Bird Genie that recognizes and identifies bird calls in the field.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">He said he began birding six years ago and photographed his sightings &#8220;because I knew I wasn&#8217;t a good enough birder for people to trust me.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The verification of sightings and combating stringing &#8212; arguable sightings by inexperienced, overeager or simply cheating birders &#8212; is one of birding&#8217;s most pressing issues and is the main argument for the use of photos.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Birding&#8217;s popularity, fueled in part by the recent films, &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/movies/the-big-year-with-owen-wilson-and-steve-martin-review.html\">The Big Year</a>,&#8221; and &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/21/movies/a-birders-guide-to-everything-starring-ben-kingsley.html\">A Birder&#8217;s Guide to Everything</a>,&#8221; is approaching an extreme-sport level, with adrenaline-pumped teams putting in sleepless days.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The <a href=\"http://aba.org/\">American Birding Association</a> has begun discussions to revise portions of its code of ethics, said Jeffrey Gordon, the association&#8217;s president. The code serves as a guideline for birders, though competition organizers are free to make their own rules. Mr. Gordon said that what little there was in the code regarding technology &#8212; there is a mention, for example, of curbing the use of &#8220;tape recorders&#8221; &#8212; has likely gone unchanged since being established a decade ago, &#8220;before people were walking around with libraries of bird songs in their pocket.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">While the honor system remains paramount, Mr. Gordon said, photographs, provided they have not been altered, can offer &#8220;a higher standard of evidence,&#8221; especially for rare sightings, and for newer birders who have yet to establish reputations of being rock-solid in their identifications.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">&#8220;I hear young birders joking around saying, &#8216;Photos or it didn&#8217;t happen,&#8217;&#160;&#8221; he said. &#8220;The expectation is that if you report something rare, you&#8217;re going to need a photograph. And I only see that increasing.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The association created a new category of competition: Photo Big Days. Last month, Mr. Whittle and Tom Stephenson, a Brooklyn-based birder who leads tours in Prospect Park, organized a Photo Big Day in Texas, and competed as well, photographing 209 birds in 24 hours, which the birding association has recognized as a record for North America.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Even purists like Mr. Dunne, a New Jersey Audubon Society official who founded the World Series, said any tool that made birding more accessible was welcome. But introducing them to competitions goes against the trust implicit in birding, the purists said, and turns what should be a contest of devotion and skill into a free-for-all where tech wizardry and expensive cameras become the de facto entry requirements.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">&#8220;We&#8217;re at a pivotal time,&#8221; Mr. Dunne said, acknowledging that birding technology was &#8220;going to change birding dramatically and probably permanently.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Drew Weber, who writes a blog about birding and technology at NemesisBird.com and helps develop birding apps, said he has heard some resentment among old guard birders toward tech-savvy ones who have gained vast birding knowledge with comparably little time spent in the field.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">&#8220;A lot of traditional birders, honing their skills for decades, had to put all this time in, and they might see technology as a shortcut,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Teams in the World Series recruit members who can identify bird calls and can scout where targeted species are likely to be seen. To prepare for the event, Mr. Van Doren&#8217;s Cornell team has spent a week driving around New Jersey using apps to log where specific birds had been spotted. They are not allowed to use apps to acquire new information during the event, but they can use them to refer to previously gathered information.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Mr. Van Doren acknowledged that technology should have its limits. The day will come, he predicted, when binoculars themselves will be able to identify birds. &#8220;That would be lame from a birding perspective,&#8221; he said, &#8220;because it would take the skill out of it.&#8221;</p>\n</div>", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "movies": [], "updated_dateime": "2014-05-11T02:49:24", "source_id": null}

(As Rick Gladstone reported, one under-appreciated driver of this act is that \u201cthe buying and selling of women and children, particularly young girls, has long been an underlying problem.\u201d)\n\nThe intent of these terrorists is to deter families from educating girls, and is all the more terrible because it\u2019s already so hard for girls to continue in education in the region beyond the primary level. Just one of many impediments is the lack of toilets, which is a particularly important issue as girls enter their teen years.\n\nHere are two areas that matter:\n\nMaternal health is greatly facilitated by the same family planning capacity that can help a woman manage her fertility. When family planning came up at the Vatican conference on sustainable development that I attended last week, it was not just in the context of population growth. It is a means of fostering healthier and more resilient communities, which is particularly important in places that are implicitly vulnerable to climate hazards like severe drought. The World Health Organization has some helpful graphics showing the continuing toll (800 women dying daily of complications from pregnancy or childbirth) and ways to save lives.\n\nThe Woodrow Wilson Center held an event last year summarizing findings and policy options related to the role of family planning in improving maternal health.\n\nSecondary-level education for girls is critical for advancing the prospects for young women, yet is still the exception in many developing countries. (The girls kidnapped in Nigeria were in high school.) Invaluable research by Wolfgang Lutz and others at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria has demonstrated this repeatedly. The core work was laid out in an important 2011 paper in Science: Global Human Capital: Integrating Education and Population. Make sure to explore the interactive graphics on demographics and education access.\n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt from a 2011 article on his work:\n\nUniversal secondary female education could\u2026lower population growth and break the vicious circle of poverty and high population growth. During the 1950s Mauritius experienced population growth rates of more than 3 percent a year. Following a strong but strictly voluntary family planning program launched by the government during the 1960s, the total fertility rate fell from more than 6 to less than 3, one of the world\u2019s most impressive fertility declines. The reason for this success, researchers believe, is that by 1962 more than 80 percent of all young women could read and write: a factor that increased access to family planning. Subsequently Mauritius experienced the benefit of the so-called demographic bonus through a decline in youth dependency combined with still very low old age dependency, resulting in a period of economic growth, investments in infrastructure, and further education. In Ethiopia women without education have on average 6 children, whereas those with a least junior secondary education have only 2.\n\nOn both fronts, there are great opportunities to make progress and make the efforts of Boko Haram and its ilk a last gasp instead of a building threat.\n\nIn parting, here\u2019s an excerpt from \u201cNo Woman No Cry\u201d \u2014 a 2010 documentary on maternal health

Following a strong but strictly voluntary family planning program launched by the government during the 1960s, the total fertility rate fell from more than 6 to less than 3, one of the world&#8217;s most impressive fertility declines.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The reason for this success, researchers believe, is that by 1962 more than 80 percent of all young women could read and write: a factor that increased access to family planning. Subsequently Mauritius experienced the benefit of the so-called demographic bonus through a decline in youth dependency combined with still very low old age dependency, resulting in a period of economic growth, investments in infrastructure, and further education. In Ethiopia women without education have on average 6 children, whereas those with a least junior secondary education have only 2.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">On both fronts, there are great opportunities to make progress and make the efforts of Boko Haram and its ilk a last gasp instead of a building threat.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">In parting, here&#8217;s an excerpt from &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1493034/\">No Woman No Cry</a>&#8221; &#8212; a 2010 documentary on maternal health problems around the world directed by <a href=\"http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/stocks/news/press_release.asp?docTag=201405020900PRIMZONEFULLFEED10079683&amp;feedID=600&amp;press_symbol=8739925\">Christy Turlington Burns</a>:</p>\n</div>", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "movies": [], "updated_dateime": "2014-05-11T02:49:24", "source_id": null}

Shane Savage.\n\nOn Sept. 3, 2010, the armored truck he was commanding near Kandahar, Afghanistan, was blown apart by a roadside bomb. His head hit the ceiling so hard that his helmet cracked. His left foot was pinned against the dashboard, crushing 24 bones.\n\nSergeant Savage came home eight days later, at age 27, with the signature injuries of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan: severe concussion, post-traumatic stress and chronic pain. Doctors at Fort Hood in Killeen, Tex., did what doctors across the nation do for millions of ordinary Americans: They prescribed powerful narcotic painkillers.\n\nWhat followed was a familiar arc of abuse and dependence and despair. At one point, Sergeant Savage was so desperate that he went into the bathroom and began swallowing narcotic tablets. He would have died had his wife, Hilary, not burst through the door.\n\nToday Sergeant Savage has survived, even prevailed, through grit, his family and a radical experiment in managing pain without narcotics. When off-duty, he pulls on cowboy boots and plays with his children, does charity work and, as part of a therapy program, rides horses. The only medication he takes for pain is Celebrex, a non-narcotic drug.\n\n\u201cYou have to find alternative ways to get out and do stuff to stay active, to get your brain off the thought process of \u2018I\u2019m in pain,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Sergeant Savage, whose ears push out from under a Texas A&M baseball cap.\n\nThe story of Sergeant Savage illuminates an effort by experts inside and outside the military to change how chronic, or long-term, pain is treated. By some estimates, tens of millions of Americans suffer from chronic pain, and the use of opioids \u2014 drugs like hydrocodone, methadone and oxycodone (the active ingredient in painkillers like OxyContin) \u2014 to treat such conditions has soared over the last decade.\n\nThis opioid boom was a result of a synchronized drumbeat sounded by pharmaceutical companies, pain experts and others who argued that the drugs could defeat pain with little risk of addiction. Insurers embraced opioids as a seemingly effective and relatively inexpensive solution to a complex problem that often involves psychological and emotional issues.\n\nIn recent years, sales of opioids have flattened because of their role in 16,000 overdose deaths annually in the United States, cases that often involve abuse of the drugs. But a growing number of specialists have sharply reduced or stopped their prescription of opioids for another reason: their belief that the drugs have led doctors to focus on the wrong goal in treating chronic pain.\n\nOpioids blunt a patient\u2019s discomfort for a time. But the drugs can become a barrier to improving how well a patient functions physically and socially, goals that appear crucial in combating chronic pain, many experts say. As a result, specialists are returning to strategies that were popular before the opioid era, like physical therapy, behavior modification and psychological counseling. Others are exploring alternative treatments like acupuncture and yoga.\n\nMany pain programs now use non-opioid drugs, including ones developed for conditions like epilepsy, that are also effective in relieving pain. \u201cWe have to change the paradigm and the culture,\u201d said Dr. Karen H. Seal, who specializes in pain treatment at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Francisco and has studied the use of opioids and other drugs in combat veterans.\n\nThese days, the biggest changes are taking place inside the military and the Department of Veterans Affairs, organizations that have drawn criticism from lawmakers and others for overprescribing opioids and other powerful medications. Physicians in those organizations have more leeway than other doctors to use alternative treatments because insurers do not govern their decisions.\n\nFive years ago, approximately 80 percent of the injured soldiers treated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington were prescribed opioids. That figure has since plummeted to 10 percent, and many patients are benefiting from the change, said Dr. Christopher Spevak, a pain specialist there.\n\n\u201cAs we decrease the amount of opioids, their healing and recovery has gotten much quicker,\u201d Dr. Spevak said. The implications go far beyond the military because most patients at Walter Reed in recent years have not been suffering from serious battlefield injuries but from problems many civilians face, like back injuries.\n\nAs long as a decade ago, some drug industry researchers questioned the value of opioids in the treatment of chronic pain even as drug producers promoted their widespread use, emails reviewed by The New York Times show.\n\n\u201cThe important issue in the treatment of chronic pain is recognizing patients with chronic and acute pain are different and require different approaches,\u201d Dr. David Hewitt, who was then the medical director of Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, a division of Johnson & Johnson, wrote in 2003 to an academic researcher. \u201cEmploying a drug alone is unlikely to lead to a successful outcome.\u201d\n\nAsked about the email, Dr. Hewitt, who later moved to Merck, declined to comment through a company spokeswoman.\n\nAll Shane Savage wanted was to be a soldier. He joined the Marines in June 2001, a day after graduating from high school in Olive, Okla. He stood 6-foot-5, had six-pack abs and was ready for adventure.\n\nAfter the Sept. 11 attacks, his engineering unit was sent to Iraq, where he served three tours before being honorably discharged in 2005. Nine months later, he wanted back in.\n\n\u201cI missed the uniform,\u201d Sergeant Savage recalled. \u201cI missed the brotherhood, the camaraderie, getting to go places and do cool stuff.\u201d\n\nTo keep his rank, he enlisted in the Army and went back to Iraq in 2007 for a fourth tour. Then, in 2010, he was deployed again, this time to Afghanistan.\n\nHe soon asked for a transfer from a construction detail to one closer to the action and was reassigned to lead a unit clearing roadside bombs.\n\nOnce Sergeant Savage was back at Fort Hood, doctors put him on an array of medications; at one point, he was taking 12 different drugs, Hilary Savage recalled.\n\n\u201cThey put him on anything and everything,\u201d she said. \u201cThey had him on pain blockers and narcotics, antidepressants, Concerta for A.D.H.D. They had him on stuff for tremors. Like, I mean, you name it, we had it in our cabinet.\u201d\n\nA month after Sergeant Savage\u2019s return, he and his wife went to pick up their daughters, Jada, 13, and Ameliea, 11, from a neighbor\u2019s house. On the way, they ran into the young daughters of the Fort Hood soldier who had been killed by a roadside bomb shortly after taking Sergeant Savage\u2019s place in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThey just kind of peered into Shane\u2019s soul, and Shane kind of turned into a completely different person,\u201d Hilary Savage said.\n\nFor two days, Sergeant Savage sat in his home and cried. Then he reached for a handful of pain pills and tried to end his life.\n\nAfter a few weeks in a psychiatric hospital, he no longer felt suicidal, but his pain and other problems persisted. He tried a program at Fort Hood in which soldiers suffering from trauma learned tai chi, yoga and other relaxation techniques. But he was not ready to change.\n\n\u201cI was very na\u00efve,\u201d Sergeant Savage said. Today, most doctors remain focused on treating physical pain, which is just one symptom of chronic pain, experts say. And as a result, they also often \u201cchase\u201d pain, increasing opioid dosages as lower amounts become ineffective, exposing patients to more side effects.\n\n\u201cIt becomes a vicious cycle,\u201d said Roger Fillingim, a pain researcher at the University of Florida and a past president of the American Pain Society, a professional medical group.\n\nA 2008 study by the Mayo Clinic found that patients who were weaned off opioids and put through a non-drug-based program experienced less pain than while on opioids and also significantly improved in function. Other studies have had similar findings.\n\nIn some cases, insurers will pay for such treatments, but the practice is not widespread because there are few standards to judge their value, said Dr. Jeffrey Livovich, a medical director at Aetna. Dr. Edward Covington, the director of the Neurological Center for Pain at the Cleveland Clinic, said he believed that companies like Aetna had another incentive not to pay: Programs like his are initially more expensive than opioids, and insurers are loath to invest in patients when they do not know if they will be their customers next year.\n\n\u201cTheir view is, why should they benefit another insurer?\u201d Dr. Covington said.\n\nWhatever the case, physicians treating soldiers or veterans are free of insurance industry dictates. And a growing number of doctors are largely abandoning opioids for the same reason that Dr. Hewitt, the former Ortho-McNeil medical director, suggested a decade ago: The drugs do not seem to help many with chronic pain.\n\n\u201cI think that the more appropriate use of opioids is in the acute pain setting and the surgical setting,\u201d said Dr. Seal, the expert in San Francisco. \u201cI am not convinced that opioids are any better than non-opioids\u201d for chronic pain, she said.\n\nFor three years, Sergeant Savage struggled to navigate through a drugged fog. Surgeons repeatedly tried to fuse the smashed bones in his foot, using metal screws and bone grafts, but each procedure eventually failed.\n\nThere were periods when he limited his use of opioids, but after each operation, he started again. By last spring, he was taking over 300 milligrams of morphine daily, a very high amount. As his dosage increased, he became more lethargic and detached.\n\n\u201cHe would just zone out on something, and he\u2019d start looking at the computer or whatever\u201d for hours, Hilary Savage recalled. \u201cThe next thing he knew, we were getting ready to go to bed.\u201d\n\nSergeant Savage\u2019s relatives tried to intervene, but nothing worked. Then, last summer, his older daughter, Jada, confronted him. She said she could no longer bear the person he had become.\n\nThat night, Sergeant Shane decided to wean himself off opioids and other powerful drugs. Soon, he and his wife were hunting for pills to throw away.\n\n\u201cI had some in my Jeep,\u201d Hilary Savage said. \u201cI had some in his car or his truck. I had some in my bedroom.\u201d\n\nTo his surprise, Sergeant Savage soon felt better, not worse.\n\n\u201cThe pain medication, it might make me feel great and golden, you know, in here,\u201d he said, pointing to his chest. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t do anything for me.\u201d\n\nHis pain continued, however, and last fall he started to consider another option: having his foot amputated. Around that time, he also heard about a V.A. hospital in Tampa, Fla., that ran a multidisciplinary pain treatment program. He arrived there in September. Some patients were much older than him, and many in the program had been on opioids for decades. Their pain and the drugs had left them housebound, disabled or addicted.\n\nDespite feeling like the odd man out, Sergeant Savage threw himself into the program, which ran three weeks. When his first attempt to make a Western-style belt in a crafts class failed because his hands were shaking too much to control the stamping tools, he didn\u2019t give up. He got a new leather strip and tried again.\n\nJennifer Murphy, a psychologist working in the Tampa program, said doctors are often too quick to dole out pain pills rather than to take advantage of alternative treatments. \u201cWhat may be easy in the moment may not be the right thing, now or down the road,\u201d she said.\n\nTwo months later, Sergeant Savage and his family visited a horse arena not far from Fort Hood. It was a cool November evening, and he looked far better than he had in Tampa. He was calmer, and his tremors, while not gone, were less frequent.\n\nHe had left the Tampa program with mixed feelings. He wished that there had been more people his age in the program and wondered why the Army didn\u2019t run similar programs for soldiers who wanted to be able to work after they left the service. Once back home, he began his own recovery plan, one that involved volunteering with groups that helped soldiers dealing with pain and trauma \u2014 work that he had done previously. But now, having found ways to cope with his pain without narcotics, he was able to throw himself into that work with new energy.\n\nThat night at the horse arena, he took part in a therapy program in which horses are used to help injured soldiers regain their sense of self-control and trust. He also volunteered for a group that ran off-road Jeep excursions for veterans and for another organization that rescued wild mustangs from federal lands for adoption.\n\n\u201cThey can sense your emotions and feelings,\u201d he said, patting a mustang. \u201cIf you are tense, they are going to be tense. If you are anxious, they are going to be anxious. Especially, if you are in pain, they are going to sense you are in pain as well.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, insurers have started cracking down on doctors who overprescribe narcotics. But it is not clear when, or if, they will embrace alternative pain treatments. Critics of the military and the Department of Veterans Affairs say the pace of change in those organizations has been too slow.\n\nAt bases like Fort Hood, soldiers like Sergeant Savage can spend years heavily medicated while awaiting a medical discharge, Ms. Savage said.\n\n\u201cI call it purgatory \u2014 you are not in heaven, and you are not in hell,\u201d she said. \u201cI can go in there and I can immediately spot people that are on narcotics or on drugs.\u201d\n\nChanging how doctors practice is not easy, but experts like Dr. Spevak and Dr. Seal are trying to push alternatives to opioids further down the chain of treatment so that patients will get them more quickly after an injury. Dr. Spevak, for example, said he expected this year to give 130 lectures about such techniques to military doctors working worldwide.\n\nIn January, Sergeant Savage underwent another operation to reconstruct his foot. He took narcotic painkillers for only a few days, and initially the procedure appeared to have stabilized his foot and reduced his pain. Then, that procedure also failed. Now, after four years of struggle, Sergeant Savage plans to undergo an amputation of part of his left leg, from the midcalf down. He\u2019ll use a prosthetic device in place of the missing limb.\n\nHis commanders at Fort Hood recently nominated him for an honor known as the Meritorious Service Medal in recognition of his volunteer work. He expects to leave the Army by the end of this year or in early 2015. Once that happens, he said, he hopes to find a job that will allow him to spend most of his time outdoors, such as running a therapy program for other veterans.\n\nSergeant Savage expects that even after the amputation, pain will be his companion wherever he goes. But he believes he can deal with it.\n\n\u201cAm I the person that I was four years ago? No. Will I ever be? No. Will I ever be able to run down the street and chase my girls? I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know what? I can get a bike and I can ride with them.\u201d", "image": null, "pub_datetime": "2014-05-10T18:34:41", "keywords": ["savage", "pain", "opioids", "drugs", "chronic", "patients", "program", "sergeant", "doctors", "soldiers", "dr", "war"], "meta_description": "After turning away from prescribed narcotics, a wounded Army sergeant has found hope.

\n     \n\n    \n    <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-1\">Four years and a lifetime ago, a new war began for Sgt. Shane Savage.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">On Sept. 3, 2010, the armored truck he was commanding near Kandahar, Afghanistan, was blown apart by a roadside bomb. His head hit the ceiling so hard that his helmet cracked. His left foot was pinned against the dashboard, crushing 24 bones.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Sergeant Savage came home eight days later, at age 27, with the signature injuries of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan: severe <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/concussion/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Concussion.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">concussion</a>, post-traumatic stress and chronic pain. Doctors at Fort Hood in Killeen, Tex., did what doctors across the nation do for millions of ordinary Americans: They prescribed powerful narcotic painkillers.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">What followed was a familiar arc of abuse and dependence and despair. At one point, Sergeant Savage was so desperate that he went into the bathroom and began swallowing narcotic tablets. He would have died had his wife, Hilary, not burst through the door.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-7\">Today Sergeant Savage has survived, even prevailed, through grit, his family and a radical experiment in managing pain without narcotics. When off-duty, he pulls on cowboy boots and plays with his children, does charity work and, as part of a therapy program, rides horses. The only medication he takes for pain is Celebrex, a non-narcotic drug.</p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;You have to find alternative ways to get out and do stuff to stay active, to get your brain off the thought process of &#8216;I&#8217;m in pain,&#8217;&#160;&#8221; said Sergeant Savage, whose ears push out from under a Texas A&amp;M baseball cap.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The story of Sergeant Savage illuminates an effort by experts inside and outside the military to change how chronic, or long-term, pain is treated. By some estimates, tens of millions of Americans suffer from chronic pain, and the use of opioids &#8212; drugs like hydrocodone, methadone and oxycodone (the active ingredient in painkillers like OxyContin) &#8212; to treat such conditions has soared over the last decade.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">This opioid boom was a result of a synchronized drumbeat sounded by pharmaceutical companies, pain experts and others who argued that the drugs could defeat pain with little risk of addiction. Insurers embraced opioids as a seemingly effective and relatively inexpensive solution to a complex problem that often involves psychological and emotional issues.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In recent years, sales of opioids have flattened because of their role in 16,000 overdose deaths annually in the United States, cases that often involve abuse of the drugs. But a growing number of specialists have sharply reduced or stopped their prescription of opioids for another reason: their belief that the drugs have led doctors to focus on the wrong goal in treating chronic pain.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Opioids blunt a patient&#8217;s discomfort for a time. But the drugs can become a barrier to improving how well a patient functions physically and socially, goals that appear crucial in combating chronic pain, many experts say. As a result, specialists are returning to strategies that were popular before the opioid era, like <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/physicaltherapy/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"Recent and archival health news about physical therapy.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">physical therapy</a>, behavior modification and psychological counseling. Others are exploring alternative treatments like <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/acupuncture/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"Recent and archival health news about acupuncture.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">acupuncture</a> and yoga.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Many pain programs now use non-opioid drugs, including ones developed for conditions like <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/epilepsy/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Epilepsy.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">epilepsy</a>, that are also effective in relieving pain. &#8220;We have to change the paradigm and the culture,&#8221; said Dr. Karen H. Seal, who specializes in pain treatment at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Francisco and has studied the use of opioids and other drugs in combat veterans.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-3\">These days, the biggest changes are taking place inside the military and the <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/v/veterans_affairs_department/index.html?inline=nyt-org\" title=\"More articles about Veterans Affairs Department, U.S.\" class=\"meta-org\">Department of Veterans Affairs</a>, organizations that have drawn criticism from lawmakers and others for overprescribing opioids and other powerful medications. Physicians in those organizations have more leeway than other doctors to use alternative treatments because insurers do not govern their decisions.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Five years ago, approximately 80 percent of the injured soldiers treated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington were prescribed opioids. That figure has since plummeted to 10 percent, and many patients are benefiting from the change, said Dr. Christopher Spevak, a pain specialist there.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;As we decrease the amount of opioids, their healing and recovery has gotten much quicker,&#8221; Dr. Spevak said. The implications go far beyond the military because most patients at Walter Reed in recent years have not been suffering from serious battlefield injuries but from problems many civilians face, like back injuries.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">As long as a decade ago, some drug industry researchers questioned the value of opioids in the treatment of chronic pain even as drug producers promoted their widespread use, emails reviewed by The New York Times show.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;The important issue in the treatment of chronic pain is recognizing patients with chronic and acute pain are different and require different approaches,&#8221; Dr. David Hewitt, who was then the medical director of Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, a division of Johnson &amp; Johnson, wrote in 2003 to an academic researcher. &#8220;Employing a drug alone is unlikely to lead to a successful outcome.&#8221;</p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Asked about the email, Dr. Hewitt, who later moved to Merck, declined to comment through a company spokeswoman.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\"><strong>A Vicious Cycle</strong></p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">All Shane Savage wanted was to be a soldier. He joined the Marines in June 2001, a day after graduating from high school in Olive, Okla. He stood 6-foot-5, had six-pack abs and was ready for adventure.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">After the Sept. 11 attacks, his engineering unit was sent to Iraq, where he served three tours before being honorably discharged in 2005. Nine months later, he wanted back in.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;I missed the uniform,&#8221; Sergeant Savage recalled. &#8220;I missed the brotherhood, the camaraderie, getting to go places and do cool stuff.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">To keep his rank, he enlisted in the Army and went back to Iraq in 2007 for a fourth tour. Then, in 2010, he was deployed again, this time to Afghanistan.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">He soon asked for a transfer from a construction detail to one closer to the action and was reassigned to lead a unit clearing roadside bombs.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Then came Sept. 3.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Once Sergeant Savage was back at Fort Hood, doctors put him on an array of medications; at one point, he was taking 12 different drugs, Hilary Savage recalled.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;They put him on anything and everything,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They had him on pain blockers and narcotics, <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/antidepressants/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"Recent and archival health news about antidepressants.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">antidepressants</a>, Concerta for <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\" class=\"meta-classifier\">A.D.H.D.</a> They had him on stuff for tremors. Like, I mean, you name it, we had it in our cabinet.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-2\">A month after Sergeant Savage&#8217;s return, he and his wife went to pick up their daughters, Jada, 13, and Ameliea, 11, from a neighbor&#8217;s house. On the way, they ran into the young daughters of the Fort Hood soldier who had been killed by a roadside bomb shortly after taking Sergeant Savage&#8217;s place in Afghanistan.</p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;They just kind of peered into Shane&#8217;s soul, and Shane kind of turned into a completely different person,&#8221; Hilary Savage said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">For two days, Sergeant Savage sat in his home and cried. Then he reached for a handful of pain pills and tried to end his life.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">After a few weeks in a psychiatric hospital, he no longer felt suicidal, but his pain and other problems persisted. He tried a program at Fort Hood in which soldiers suffering from trauma learned tai chi, yoga and other relaxation techniques. But he was not ready to change.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-4\">&#8220;I was very na&#239;ve,&#8221; Sergeant Savage said. Today, most doctors remain focused on treating physical pain, which is just one symptom of chronic pain, experts say. And as a result, they also often &#8220;chase&#8221; pain, increasing opioid dosages as lower amounts become ineffective, exposing patients to more side effects.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;It becomes a vicious cycle,&#8221; said Roger Fillingim, a pain researcher at the University of Florida and a past president of the <a title=\"The group&#8217;s website.\" href=\"http://www.americanpainsociety.org/\">American Pain Society</a>, a professional medical group.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-8\">A 2008 <a title=\"Abstract of the study.\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18804915\">study</a> by the Mayo Clinic found that patients who were weaned off opioids and put through a non-drug-based program experienced less pain than while on opioids and also significantly improved in function. <a title=\"Abstract of a study.\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22751033\">Other</a> <a title=\"Abstract of a study.\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23915328\">studies</a> have had similar findings.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In some cases, insurers will pay for such treatments, but the practice is not widespread because there are few standards to judge their value, said Dr. Jeffrey Livovich, a medical director at Aetna. Dr. Edward Covington, the director of the <a title=\"The center&#8217;s website.\" href=\"http://my.clevelandclinic.org/neurological_institute/neurological-center-for-pain/default.aspx\">Neurological Center for Pain</a> at the Cleveland Clinic, said he believed that companies like Aetna had another incentive not to pay: Programs like his are initially more expensive than opioids, and insurers are loath to invest in patients when they do not know if they will be their customers next year.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;Their view is, why should they benefit another insurer?&#8221; Dr. Covington said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Whatever the case, physicians treating soldiers or veterans are free of insurance industry dictates. And a growing number of doctors are largely abandoning opioids for the same reason that Dr. Hewitt, the former Ortho-McNeil medical director, suggested a decade ago: The drugs do not seem to help many with chronic pain.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;I think that the more appropriate use of opioids is in the acute pain setting and the surgical setting,&#8221; said Dr. Seal, the expert in San Francisco. &#8220;I am not convinced that opioids are any better than non-opioids&#8221; for chronic pain, she said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\"><strong>Kicking the Habit</strong></p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">For three years, Sergeant Savage struggled to navigate through a drugged fog. Surgeons repeatedly tried to fuse the smashed bones in his foot, using metal screws and bone grafts, but each procedure eventually failed.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">There were periods when he limited his use of opioids, but after each operation, he started again. By last spring, he was taking over 300 milligrams of morphine daily, a very high amount. As his dosage increased, he became more lethargic and detached.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;He would just zone out on something, and he&#8217;d start looking at the computer or whatever&#8221; for hours, Hilary Savage recalled. &#8220;The next thing he knew, we were getting ready to go to bed.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-6\">Sergeant Savage&#8217;s relatives tried to intervene, but nothing worked. Then, last summer, his older daughter, Jada, confronted him. She said she could no longer bear the person he had become.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">That night, Sergeant Shane decided to wean himself off opioids and other powerful drugs. Soon, he and his wife were hunting for pills to throw away.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;I had some in my Jeep,&#8221; Hilary Savage said. &#8220;I had some in his car or his truck. I had some in my bedroom.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">To his surprise, Sergeant Savage soon felt better, not worse.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;The pain medication, it might make me feel great and golden, you know, in here,&#8221; he said, pointing to his chest. &#8220;But it didn&#8217;t do anything for me.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">His pain continued, however, and last fall he started to consider another option: having his foot amputated. Around that time, he also heard about a V.A. hospital in Tampa, Fla., that ran a multidisciplinary pain treatment program. He arrived there in September. Some patients were much older than him, and many in the program had been on opioids for decades. Their pain and the drugs had left them housebound, disabled or addicted.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-5\">Despite feeling like the odd man out, Sergeant Savage threw himself into the program, which ran three weeks. When his first attempt to make a Western-style belt in a crafts class failed because his hands were shaking too much to control the stamping tools, he didn&#8217;t give up. He got a new leather strip and tried again.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Jennifer Murphy, a psychologist working in the Tampa program, said doctors are often too quick to dole out pain pills rather than to take advantage of alternative treatments. &#8220;What may be easy in the moment may not be the right thing, now or down the road,&#8221; she said.</p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Two months later, Sergeant Savage and his family visited a horse arena not far from Fort Hood. It was a cool November evening, and he looked far better than he had in Tampa. He was calmer, and his tremors, while not gone, were less frequent.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">He had left the Tampa program with mixed feelings. He wished that there had been more people his age in the program and wondered why the Army didn&#8217;t run similar programs for soldiers who wanted to be able to work after they left the service. Once back home, he began his own recovery plan, one that involved volunteering with groups that helped soldiers dealing with pain and trauma &#8212; work that he had done previously. But now, having found ways to cope with his pain without narcotics, he was able to throw himself into that work with new energy.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">That night at the horse arena, he took part in a therapy program in which horses are used to help injured soldiers regain their sense of self-control and trust. He also volunteered for a group that ran off-road Jeep excursions for veterans and for another organization that rescued wild mustangs from federal lands for adoption.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;They can sense your emotions and feelings,&#8221; he said, patting a mustang. &#8220;If you are tense, they are going to be tense. If you are anxious, they are going to be anxious. Especially, if you are in pain, they are going to sense you are in pain as well.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\"><strong>A Permanent Companion</strong></p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In recent years, insurers have started cracking down on doctors who overprescribe narcotics. But it is not clear when, or if, they will embrace alternative pain treatments. Critics of the military and the Department of Veterans Affairs say the pace of change in those organizations has been too slow.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">At bases like Fort Hood, soldiers like Sergeant Savage can spend years heavily medicated while awaiting a medical discharge, Ms. Savage said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;I call it purgatory &#8212; you are not in heaven, and you are not in hell,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I can go in there and I can immediately spot people that are on narcotics or on drugs.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Changing how doctors practice is not easy, but experts like Dr. Spevak and Dr. Seal are trying to push alternatives to opioids further down the chain of treatment so that patients will get them more quickly after an injury. Dr. Spevak, for example, said he expected this year to give 130 lectures about such techniques to military doctors working worldwide.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In January, Sergeant Savage underwent another operation to reconstruct his foot. He took narcotic painkillers for only a few days, and initially the procedure appeared to have stabilized his foot and reduced his pain. Then, that procedure also failed. Now, after four years of struggle, Sergeant Savage plans to undergo an amputation of part of his left leg, from the midcalf down. He&#8217;ll use a prosthetic device in place of the missing limb.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-9\">His commanders at Fort Hood recently nominated him for an honor known as the Meritorious Service Medal in recognition of his volunteer work. He expects to leave the Army by the end of this year or in early 2015. Once that happens, he said, he hopes to find a job that will allow him to spend most of his time outdoors, such as running a therapy program for other veterans.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Sergeant Savage expects that even after the amputation, pain will be his companion wherever he goes. But he believes he can deal with it.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;Am I the person that I was four years ago? No. Will I ever be? No. Will I ever be able to run down the street and chase my girls? I really don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But you know what? I can get a bike and I can ride with them.&#8221;</p>    \n     \n\n                 \n      \n</div>", "meta_favicon": "http://static01.nyt.com/favicon.ico", "movies": [], "updated_dateime": "2014-05-11T02:49:24", "source_id": null}
{"domain": "rss.nytimes.com", "meta_keywords": ["Mill Valley (Calif)", "Education (K-12)", "Computers and the Internet", "Code.org"], "text": "MILL VALLEY, Calif. \u2014 Seven-year-old Jordan Lisle, a second grader, joined his family at a packed after-hours school event last month aimed at inspiring a new interest: computer programming.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little afraid he\u2019s falling behind,\u201d his mother, Wendy Lisle, said, explaining why they had signed up for the class at Strawberry Point Elementary School.\n\nThe event was part of a national educational movement in computer coding instruction that is growing at Internet speeds. Since December, 20,000 teachers from kindergarten through 12th grade have introduced coding lessons, according to Code.org, a group backed by the tech industry that offers free curriculums. In addition, some 30 school districts, including New York City and Chicago, have agreed to add coding classes in the fall, mainly in high schools but in lower grades, too. And policy makers in nine states have begun awarding the same credits for computer science classes that they do for basic math and science courses, rather than treating them as electives.\n\nThere are after-school events, too, like the one in Mill Valley, where 70 parents and 90 children, from kindergartners to fifth graders, huddled over computers solving animated puzzles to learn the basics of computer logic.\n\nIt is a stark change for computer science, which for decades was treated like a stepchild, equated with trade classes like wood shop. But smartphones and apps are ubiquitous now, and engineering careers are hot. To many parents \u2014 particularly ones here in the heart of the technology corridor \u2014 coding looks less like an extracurricular activity and more like a basic life skill, one that might someday lead to a great job or even instant riches.\n\nThe spread of coding instruction, while still nascent, is \u201cunprecedented \u2014 there\u2019s never been a move this fast in education,\u201d said Elliot Soloway, a professor of education and computer science at the University of Michigan. He sees it as very positive, potentially inspiring students to develop a new passion, perhaps the way that teaching frog dissection may inspire future surgeons and biologists.\n\nBut the momentum for early coding comes with caveats, too. It is not clear that teaching basic computer science in grade school will beget future jobs or foster broader creativity and logical thinking, as some champions of the movement are projecting. And particularly for younger children, Dr. Soloway said, the activity is more like a video game \u2014 better than simulated gunplay, but not likely to impart actual programming skills.\n\nSome educators worry about the industry\u2019s heavy role: Major tech companies and their founders, including Bill Gates and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, have put up about $10 million for Code.org. The organization pays to train high school teachers to offer more advanced curriculums, and, for younger students, it has developed a coding curriculum that marries basic instruction with video games involving Angry Birds and hungry zombies.\n\nThe lessons do not involve traditional computer language. Rather, they use simple word commands \u2014 like \u201cmove forward\u201d or \u201cturn right\u201d \u2014 that children can click on and move around to, say, direct an Angry Bird to capture a pig.\n\nAcross the country, districts are signing up piecemeal. Chicago\u2019s public school system hopes to have computer science as a graduation requirement at all of its 187 high schools in five years, and to have the instruction in 25 percent of other schools. New York City public schools are training 60 teachers for classes this fall in 40 high schools, in part to prepare students for college.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big demand for these skills in both the tech sector and across all sectors,\u201d said Britt Neuhaus, the director of special projects at the office of innovation for New York City schools. The city plans to expand the training for 2015 and is considering moving it into middle schools.\n\nThe movement comes with no shortage of \u201cwe\u2019re changing the world\u201d marketing fervor from Silicon Valley. \u201cThis is strategically significant for the economy of the United States,\u201d said John Pearce, a technology entrepreneur. He and another entrepreneur, Jeff Leane, have started a nonprofit, MV Gate, to bring youth and family coding courses developed by Code.org to Mill Valley, an affluent suburb across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.\n\nParents love the idea of giving children something to do with computers that they see as productive, Mr. Pearce said. \u201cWe have any number of parents who say, \u2018I can\u2019t take my kid playing one more hour of video games,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. But if the children are exploring coding, the parents tell him, \u201c\u00a0\u2018I can live with that all night long.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n\nThe concept has caught on with James Meezan, a second grader. He attended one of the first \u201cHour of Code\u201d events sponsored by MV Gate in December with his mother, Karen Meezan, the local PTA president and a former tech-industry executive who now runs a real estate company. She is among the enthusiastic supporters of the coding courses, along with several local principals.\n\nHer son, she said, does well in school but had not quite found his special interest and was \u201cnot the fastest runner on the playground.\u201d But he loves programming and spends at least an hour a week at CodeKids, after-school programs organized by MV Gate and held at three of Mill Valley\u2019s five elementary schools.\n\nJames, 8, explained that programming is \u201cgetting the computer to do something by itself.\u201d It is fun, he said, and, besides, if he gets good, he might be able to do stuff like get a computer to turn on when it has suddenly died. His mother said he had found his niche; when it comes to programming, \u201che is the fastest runner.\u201d\n\nOther youngsters seemed more bewildered, at least at first. \u201cThe Google guys might\u2019ve been coders, and the Facebook guys \u2014 I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Sammy Smith, a vibrant 10-year-old girl, when she arrived at the coding event at Strawberry Point.\n\nBut well into the session, she and her fifth-grade friends were digging in, moving basic command blocks to get the Angry Bird to its prey, and then playing with slightly more complex commands like \u201crepeat\u201d and learning about \u201cif-then\u201d statements, an elemental coding concept. The crowd had plenty of high-tech parents, including Scott Wong, director of engineering at Twitter. His 7-year-old son, Taeden, seemed alternately transfixed and confused by the puzzles on the laptop, while his 5-year-old brother, Sai, sat next to him, fidgeting.\n\nThe use of these word-command blocks to simplify coding logic stems largely from the work of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab, which introduced a visual programming language called Scratch in 2007. It claims a following of millions of users, but mostly outside the schools.\n\nThen, in 2013, came Code.org, which borrowed basic Scratch ideas and aimed to spread the concept among schools and policy makers. Computer programming should be taught in every school, said Hadi Partovi, the founder of Code.org and a former executive at Microsoft. He called it as essential as \u201clearning about gravity or molecules, electricity or photosynthesis.\u201d\n\nAmong the 20,000 teachers who Code.org says have signed on is Alana Aaron, a fifth-grade math and science teacher in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. She heard about the idea late last year at a professional development meeting and, with her principal\u2019s permission, swapped a two-month earth sciences lesson she was going to teach on land masses for the Code.org curriculum.\n\n\u201cComputer science is big right now \u2014 in our country, the world,\u201d she said. \u201cIf my kids aren\u2019t exposed to things like that, they could miss out on potential opportunities and careers.\u201d", "image": null, "pub_datetime": "2014-05-10T23:39:31", "keywords": ["school", "programming", "coding", "lately", "computer", "parents", "writing",

"article_html": "<div>\n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-1\">MILL VALLEY, Calif. &#8212; Seven-year-old Jordan Lisle, a second grader, joined his family at a packed after-hours school event last month aimed at inspiring a new interest: computer programming.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;I&#8217;m a little afraid he&#8217;s falling behind,&#8221; his mother, Wendy Lisle, said, explaining why they had signed up for the class at Strawberry Point Elementary School.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-5\">The event was part of a national educational movement in computer coding instruction that is growing at Internet speeds. Since December, 20,000 teachers from kindergarten through 12th grade have introduced coding lessons, according to <a title=\"Website.\" href=\"http://code.org/\">Code.org</a>, a group backed by the tech industry that offers free curriculums. In addition, some 30 school districts, including New York City and Chicago, have agreed to add coding classes in the fall, mainly in high schools but in lower grades, too. And policy makers in nine states have begun awarding the same credits for computer science classes that they do for basic math and science courses, rather than treating them as electives.</p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">There are after-school events, too, like the one in Mill Valley, where 70 parents and 90 children, from kindergartners to fifth graders, huddled over computers solving animated puzzles to learn the basics of computer logic.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">It is a stark change for computer science, which for decades was treated like a stepchild, equated with trade classes like wood shop. But smartphones and apps are ubiquitous now, and engineering careers are hot. To many parents &#8212; particularly ones here in the heart of the technology corridor &#8212; coding looks less like an extracurricular activity and more like a basic life skill, one that might someday lead to a great job or even instant riches.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-2\">The spread of coding instruction, while still nascent, is &#8220;unprecedented &#8212; there&#8217;s never been a move this fast in education,&#8221; said Elliot Soloway, a professor of education and computer science at the University of Michigan. He sees it as very positive, potentially inspiring students to develop a new passion, perhaps the way that teaching frog dissection may inspire future surgeons and biologists.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">But the momentum for early coding comes with caveats, too. It is not clear that teaching basic computer science in grade school will beget future jobs or foster broader creativity and logical thinking, as some champions of the movement are projecting. And particularly for younger children, Dr. Soloway said, the activity is more like a video game &#8212; better than simulated gunplay, but not likely to impart actual programming skills.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Some educators worry about the industry&#8217;s heavy role: Major tech companies and their founders, including Bill Gates and Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg, have put up about $10 million for Code.org. The organization pays to train high school teachers to offer more advanced curriculums, and, for younger students, it has developed a coding curriculum that marries basic instruction with video games involving Angry Birds and hungry zombies.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The lessons do not involve traditional computer language. Rather, they use simple word commands &#8212; like &#8220;move forward&#8221; or &#8220;turn right&#8221; &#8212; that children can click on and move around to, say, direct an Angry Bird to capture a pig.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-3\">Across the country, districts are signing up piecemeal. Chicago&#8217;s public school system hopes to have computer science as a graduation requirement at all of its 187 high schools in five years, and to have the instruction in 25 percent of other schools. New York City public schools are training 60 teachers for classes this fall in 40 high schools, in part to prepare students for college.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;There&#8217;s a big demand for these skills in both the tech sector and across all sectors,&#8221; said Britt Neuhaus, the director of special projects at the office of innovation for New York City schools. The city plans to expand the training for 2015 and is considering moving it into middle schools.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-6\">The movement comes with no shortage of &#8220;we&#8217;re changing the world&#8221; marketing fervor from Silicon Valley. &#8220;This is strategically significant for the economy of the United States,&#8221; said John Pearce, a technology entrepreneur. He and another entrepreneur, Jeff Leane, have started a nonprofit, <a title=\"Website.\" href=\"http://mvgate.org/\">MV Gate</a>, to bring youth and family coding courses developed by Code.org to Mill Valley, an affluent suburb across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Parents love the idea of giving children something to do with computers that they see as productive, Mr. Pearce said. &#8220;We have any number of parents who say, &#8216;I can&#8217;t take my kid playing one more hour of video games,&#8217;&#160;&#8221; he said. But if the children are exploring coding, the parents tell him, &#8220;&#160;&#8216;I can live with that all night long.&#8217;&#160;&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The concept has caught on with James Meezan, a second grader. He attended one of the first &#8220;Hour of Code&#8221; events sponsored by MV Gate in December with his mother, Karen Meezan, the local PTA president and a former tech-industry executive who now runs a real estate company. She is among the enthusiastic supporters of the coding courses, along with several local principals.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Her son, she said, does well in school but had not quite found his special interest and was &#8220;not the fastest runner on the playground.&#8221; But he loves programming and spends at least an hour a week at CodeKids, after-school programs organized by MV Gate and held at three of Mill Valley&#8217;s five elementary schools.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">James, 8, explained that programming is &#8220;getting the computer to do something by itself.&#8221; It is fun, he said, and, besides, if he gets good, he might be able to do stuff like get a computer to turn on when it has suddenly died. His mother said he had found his niche; when it comes to programming, &#8220;he is the fastest runner.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Other youngsters seemed more bewildered, at least at first. &#8220;The Google guys might&#8217;ve been coders, and the Facebook guys &#8212; I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Sammy Smith, a vibrant 10-year-old girl, when she arrived at the coding event at Strawberry Point.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">But well into the session, she and her fifth-grade friends were digging in, moving basic command blocks to get the Angry Bird to its prey, and then playing with slightly more complex commands like &#8220;repeat&#8221; and learning about &#8220;if-then&#8221; statements, an elemental coding concept. The crowd had plenty of high-tech parents, including Scott Wong, director of engineering at Twitter. His 7-year-old son, Taeden, seemed alternately transfixed and confused by the puzzles on the laptop, while his 5-year-old brother, Sai, sat next to him, fidgeting.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The use of these word-command blocks to simplify coding logic stems largely from the work of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab, which introduced a visual programming language called Scratch in 2007. It claims a following of millions of users, but mostly outside the schools.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-7\">Then, in 2013, came Code.org, which borrowed basic Scratch ideas and aimed to spread the concept among schools and policy makers. Computer programming should be taught in every school, said Hadi Partovi, the founder of Code.org and a former executive at Microsoft. He called it as essential as &#8220;learning about gravity or molecules, electricity or photosynthesis.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Among the 20,000 teachers who Code.org says have signed on is Alana Aaron, a fifth-grade math and science teacher in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. She heard about the idea late last year at a professional development meeting and, with her principal&#8217;s permission, swapped a two-month earth sciences lesson she was going to teach on land masses for the Code.org curriculum.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;Computer science is big right now &#8212; in our country, the world,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If my kids aren&#8217;t exposed to things like that, they could miss out on potential opportunities and careers.&#8221;</p>    \n     \n\n              \n</div>", "meta_favicon": "http://static01.nyt.com/favicon.ico", "movies": [], "updated_dateime": "2014-05-11T02:49:24", "source_id": null}

Many of us will be using chemicals like glyphosate, carbaryl, malathion and 2,4-D. But they can end up in drinking water, and in some cases these compounds or their breakdown products are linked to an increased risk for cancer and hormonal disruption.\n\nSome of those chemicals are also used by farmworkers, and there is a growing recognition that they can be hazardous. The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing regulations that will limit farmworkers\u2019 exposure to dangerous pesticides and is accepting comments on these changes through June 17.\u00a0These new rules are meant to reduce the incidence of diseases associated with pesticide exposure, including non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, prostate cancer, Parkinson\u2019s disease and lung cancer.\n\nHomeowners who use these toxins on their yards and gardens are exposing themselves to the same risks. They aren\u2019t necessary. We don\u2019t need them to have pleasant environments. Together we can make a substantial improvement in our water quality simply by refraining from using synthetic pesticides, weedkillers and fertilizers on a routine basis. Occasional localized use to deal with an otherwise uncontainable infestation, or to deal mindfully with an invasive species, is not the problem, but routine, frequent and widespread use is.\n\nThe United States Fish and Wildlife Service says homeowners use up to 10 times more chemicals per acre than farmers do. Some of these chemicals rub off on children or pets, but most are washed with rainwater into our streams, lakes and rivers or are absorbed into our groundwater. These are the sources of our drinking water, and tests show these chemicals are indeed contaminating our water supply.\n\nA study by the United States Geological Survey released in 1999 found at least one pesticide, and often more than one, in almost every stream and fish sample tested, and in about half of the samples drawn from wells throughout the country. These pesticides are going from our lawns and gardens into our drinking water and into our bodies.\n\nThe amounts of these chemicals are small and often considered \u201cacceptable,\u201d but scientists now know that they have a cumulative effect. Many chemicals that we use very casually on our lawns cause long-term health problems in ways that have only recently been understood. They \u201cdisrupt,\u201d or throw out of whack, the endocrine system, made up of glands and hormones that control almost every aspect of our bodies\u2019 functions.\n\nIn 2009 the Endocrine Society, a group of doctors, researchers and educators who specialize in diseases related to the hormonal system, published a scientific statement based on 485 citations from research papers showing growing evidence that there are significant health threats caused by endocrine-disrupting substances in our environment. In terms of scientific research, 2009 is relatively recent. Epidemiologic studies take decades, and developing a battery of reliable laboratory tests also takes many years. This means that there are more studies implicating older chemicals, many of which are no longer sold because of known toxicities.\n\nBut many scientists expect similar chemicals now in widespread use to cause the same problems. Endocrine disrupters are linked to an increased risk for breast and prostate cancer, thyroid abnormalities and infertility. The Endocrine Society paper and others also present evidence that links exposure to chemical contaminants to diabetes and obesity.\n\nThese chemicals are not safe just because they are available in stores. Regulations governing the sale of chemicals do not reflect this new scientific information, because scientists are only now working on standardized tests both in laboratory animals and cell cultures to evaluate whether a chemical disrupts the hormonal system, and if so, at what level.\n\nWhat we put on our lawns and down our drains winds up in our drinking water, and it is not removed by water treatment. Bottled water is not a solution because it comes from the same sources and is susceptible to the same contaminants. But if we don\u2019t put these chemicals in our yards, they won\u2019t be in our drinking water.\n\nIn the last decade or so, plenty of homeowners have been rejecting the emerald green lawn and planting with species that do not demand chemicals and constant watering. But not nearly enough of us have taken that step. We need to see a perfect lawn not as enviable, but a sign of harm.\n\nNatural care of our yards and gardens is surprisingly easy. Increasing diversity in a lawn by adding clover helps supply nutrition naturally because clover fixes nitrogen from the air and makes it available to other plants. Leaving grass clippings not only returns nitrogen to the lawn, but also prevents it from drying out. Letting grass grow to four inches allows the roots to grow long so the grass can absorb more water and excess nutrients during a storm, and withstand a drought. Plants that are native to your region require less water and care and support animals and wildlife, so you will see more birds and butterflies.\n\nIn my yard in New York, native Annabelle hydrangeas, echinacea and bee balm take almost no care, are beautiful and provide nectar for bees and butterflies. American elderberry, Carolina rose and bayberry are resilient attractive shrubs that also support our local wildlife. Bats can live under the loose bark of our shagbark hickory, and oaks support woodpeckers, deer, mice and birds. We have learned to appreciate clover and dandelions because they supply sustenance to endangered monarch butterflies until milkweed blooms later in the season.\n\nThis is a surprisingly easy way to leave cleaner water and a healthier population.", "image": null, "pub_datetime": "2014-05-10T19:30:00", "keywords": ["lawn", "hormonal", "scientific", "endocrine", "tests", "water", "toxic",

The <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/environmental_protection_agency/index.html?inline=nyt-org\" title=\"More articles about the Environmental Protection Agency.\" class=\"meta-org\">Environmental Protection Agency</a> is proposing regulations that will limit farmworkers&#8217; exposure to dangerous <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/nutrition/pesticides/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Pesticides.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">pesticides</a> and is accepting comments on these changes through June 17.&#160;These new rules are meant to reduce the incidence of diseases associated with pesticide exposure, including non-<a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/hodgkins-lymphoma/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Hodgkin's Disease.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma</a>, <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/prostate-cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Prostate Cancer.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">prostate cancer</a>, <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/parkinsons-disease/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Parkinson's Disease.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">Parkinson&#8217;s disease</a> and lung cancer.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Homeowners who use these toxins on their yards and gardens are exposing themselves to the same risks. They aren&#8217;t necessary. We don&#8217;t need them to have pleasant environments. Together we can make a substantial improvement in our water quality simply by refraining from using synthetic pesticides, weedkillers and fertilizers on a routine basis. Occasional localized use to deal with an otherwise uncontainable infestation, or to deal mindfully with an invasive species, is not the problem, but routine, frequent and widespread use is.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The United States Fish and Wildlife Service says homeowners use up to 10 times more chemicals per acre than farmers do. Some of these chemicals rub off on children or pets, but most are washed with rainwater into our streams, lakes and rivers or are absorbed into our groundwater. These are the sources of our drinking water, and tests show these chemicals are indeed contaminating our water supply.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">A study by the United States Geological Survey released in 1999 found at least one pesticide, and often more than one, in almost every stream and fish sample tested, and in about half of the samples drawn from wells throughout the country. These pesticides are going from our lawns and gardens into our drinking water and into our bodies.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The amounts of these chemicals are small and often considered &#8220;acceptable,&#8221; but scientists now know that they have a cumulative effect. Many chemicals that we use very casually on our lawns cause long-term health problems in ways that have only recently been understood. They &#8220;disrupt,&#8221; or throw out of whack, the endocrine system, made up of glands and hormones that control almost every aspect of our bodies&#8217; functions.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In 2009 the Endocrine Society, a group of doctors, researchers and educators who specialize in diseases related to the hormonal system, published a scientific statement based on 485 citations from research papers showing growing evidence that there are significant health threats caused by endocrine-disrupting substances in our environment. In terms of scientific research, 2009 is relatively recent. Epidemiologic studies take decades, and developing a battery of reliable laboratory tests also takes many years. This means that there are more studies implicating older chemicals, many of which are no longer sold because of known toxicities.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">But many scientists expect similar chemicals now in widespread use to cause the same problems. Endocrine disrupters are linked to an increased risk for breast and prostate cancer, thyroid abnormalities and infertility. The Endocrine Society paper and others also present evidence that links exposure to chemical contaminants to <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/diabetes/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Diabetes.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">diabetes</a> and <a href=\"http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/morbid-obesity/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"In-depth reference and news articles about Obesity.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">obesity</a>.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-2\">These chemicals are not safe just because they are available in stores. Regulations governing the sale of chemicals do not reflect this new scientific information, because scientists are only now working on standardized tests both in laboratory animals and cell cultures to evaluate whether a chemical disrupts the hormonal system, and if so, at what level.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">What we put on our lawns and down our drains winds up in our drinking water, and it is not removed by water treatment. Bottled water is not a solution because it comes from the same sources and is susceptible to the same contaminants. But if we don&#8217;t put these chemicals in our yards, they won&#8217;t be in our drinking water.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In the last decade or so, plenty of homeowners have been rejecting the emerald green lawn and planting with species that do not demand chemicals and constant watering. But not nearly enough of us have taken that step. We need to see a perfect lawn not as enviable, but a sign of harm.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Natural care of our yards and gardens is surprisingly easy. Increasing diversity in a lawn by adding clover helps supply nutrition naturally because clover fixes nitrogen from the air and makes it available to other plants. Leaving grass clippings not only returns nitrogen to the lawn, but also prevents it from drying out. Letting grass grow to four inches allows the roots to grow long so the grass can absorb more water and excess nutrients during a storm, and withstand a drought. Plants that are native to your region require less water and care and support animals and wildlife, so you will see more birds and butterflies.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In my yard in New York, native Annabelle hydrangeas, echinacea and bee balm take almost no care, are beautiful and provide nectar for bees and butterflies. American elderberry, Carolina rose and bayberry are resilient attractive shrubs that also support our local wildlife. Bats can live under the loose bark of our shagbark hickory, and oaks support woodpeckers, deer, mice and birds. We have learned to appreciate clover and dandelions because they supply sustenance to endangered monarch butterflies until milkweed blooms later in the season.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">This is a surprisingly easy way to leave cleaner water and a healthier population.</p>    \n     \n\n                 \n      \n</div>", "meta_favicon": "http://static01.nyt.com/favicon.ico", "movies": [], "updated_dateime": "2014-05-11T02:49:24", "source_id": null}

In previous years, some garden centers may have sold half their stock at this point in the spring. Now they are barely getting started.\n\nDuring what would typically be the busiest week of the year at garden centers in anticipation of Mother\u2019s Day, some customers who have showed up there were frantic, sharing tales of woe about backyard gardens that have been decimated by the cold winter, asking for remedies from staff members and questioning why some new plants are not available, as they have been in previous years.\n\n\u201cPeople come in and say, \u2018Where are all your tomatoes? Where are all your peppers?\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Gilbert Yerke, the owner of Yerke Frog Alley Greenhouses in Mukwonago, a village in the farm-rich southeastern region of Wisconsin.\n\nStanding in the shadow of a 200-year-old oak tree, Mr. Yerke pointed to a cart of plants with green stems and leaves, but no flowers. \u201cUsually the lilacs are blooming by now,\u201d he said, \u201cand they\u2019re nowhere near.\u201d\n\nUnder the light of spring, homeowners have discovered that their carefully tended backyards now look more like plant graveyards. Perennials like roses and clematis, instead of reappearing on schedule in early May blooming in lush shades of violet and crimson, have withered instead under the bitter cold.\n\nEvergreen trees have dried out and succumbed to \u201cwinter burn,\u201d with once-bright green needles the color of rust. Rabbits and mice unable to find their usual sources of food throughout the frozen winter were forced to be enterprising, chewing the bark from stems of burning bushes and apple trees instead, often a death sentence for the plants. Road salts seeped onto lawns, turning ribbons of grass a sickly brownish hue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just ridiculous,\u201d said Kathy Nuzzo, 63, as she loaded basil, oregano and cilantro plants into her pickup at Burr Oaks Greenhouse in Somers, Wis., on Friday morning. \u201cI lost about 20 yews this winter that were at least 30 years old. They\u2019re all dead.\u201d\n\nIt is the second time in only three years that the Midwest has suffered whiplash from spring weather extremes.\n\nTwo years ago, summerlike temperatures arrived in March, causing an unusually early bloom for cherry trees that were fooled into thinking it was spring. When a deep freeze followed, most of the cherry crop in Michigan and Wisconsin was lost.\n\nThis spring, it has been so cool and damp that many Midwesterners have scarcely ventured out into their backyards. Patio furniture is still packed away in garages, collecting dust. Lawns have scarcely needed mowing, if at all.\n\n\u201cThe weather has been so miserable that people haven\u2019t been able to clear up their yards,\u201d Nancy Hazard, the owner of Country Gardens Perennials in Oconomowoc, Wis. \u201cBusiness is definitely slower this year.\u201d\n\nAt the Prairie Pedlar nursery in Odebolt, Iowa, the owners wrote a special message on their website for customers who were discouraged by the \u201cchallenges already mounting\u201d for the 2014 gardening season: \u201cKeep calm and garden on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a mixed-up Mother Nature,\u201d said Jane Hogue, an owner. \u201cIt\u2019s the most severe extremes we\u2019ve had. People are so disappointed that they\u2019ve lost so many plants and flowers. I\u2019m sure there isn\u2019t a living mum in all of northwest Iowa.\u201d\n\nAt the Chicago Botanic Garden in Glencoe, Ill., staff members are assessing the damage that winter has wrought, removing dead plants and pruning damaged ones.\n\nCertain plants that were \u201con the edge of their hardiness\u201d in the Great Lakes climate, like Japanese maples, did not survive. Tim Johnson, the director of horticulture, said he planned to have some of them replanted anyway.\n\n\u201cI hope we don\u2019t have another winter like this one,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping it was an unusual winter.\u201d\n\nA regional report from the National Gardening Association says spring gardens in the Midwest can be planted mid-March through mid-May, an estimate that gardeners this year have scoffed at.\n\nMore than 37 million households in the United States keep gardens.\n\nMeteorologists have suggested that the brisk temperatures could continue, with the lingering ice cover on parts of the Great Lakes chilling the air that moves above it.\n\nMany home gardeners are skittish about putting plants in the ground at all, preferring to wait until after Memorial Day, when the chance of a nighttime frost is remote.\n\nBut Mark Pankus, the nursery manager of Pesche\u2019s Greenhouse in Lake Geneva, Wis., said he hoped the warm weather forecast for Mother\u2019s Day weekend would signal to people in the Midwest that winter is finally over.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been so cold so long, but you\u2019ve got to believe it\u2019s finished,\u201d he said, adding that he thought it was safe to begin spring gardening rituals, even if people are spooked by the weather. \u201cIt\u2019s time. Dig it.

way to the frustrated Midwestern gardener.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The stubbornly cool spring, on the heels of a bone-chilling winter, has produced the most dismal start to the season in decades, nursery owners say. In previous years, some garden centers may have sold half their stock at this point in the spring. Now they are barely getting started.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">During what would typically be the busiest week of the year at garden centers in anticipation of Mother&#8217;s Day, some customers who have showed up there were frantic, sharing tales of woe about backyard gardens that have been decimated by the cold winter, asking for remedies from staff members and questioning why some new plants are not available, as they have been in previous years.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;People come in and say, &#8216;Where are all your tomatoes? Where are all your peppers?&#8217;&#160;&#8221; said Gilbert Yerke, the owner of <a title=\"The website.\" href=\"http://www.yerkegreenhouses.com/\">Yerke Frog Alley Greenhouses</a> in Mukwonago, a village in the farm-rich southeastern region of Wisconsin.</p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Standing in the shadow of a 200-year-old oak tree, Mr. Yerke pointed to a cart of plants with green stems and leaves, but no flowers. &#8220;Usually the lilacs are blooming by now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and they&#8217;re nowhere near.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Under the light of spring, homeowners have discovered that their carefully tended backyards now look more like plant graveyards. Perennials like roses and clematis, instead of reappearing on schedule in early May blooming in lush shades of violet and crimson, have withered instead under the bitter cold.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Evergreen trees have dried out and succumbed to &#8220;winter burn,&#8221; with once-bright green needles the color of rust. Rabbits and mice unable to find their usual sources of food throughout the frozen winter were forced to be enterprising, chewing the bark from stems of burning bushes and apple trees instead, often a death sentence for the plants. Road salts seeped onto lawns, turning ribbons of grass a sickly brownish hue.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;It&#8217;s just ridiculous,&#8221; said Kathy Nuzzo, 63, as she loaded basil, oregano and cilantro plants into her pickup at <a title=\"The Facebook page.\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Burr-Oaks-Greenhouse-Country-Gift-Shoppe/123551087702956\">Burr Oaks Greenhouse</a> in Somers, Wis., on Friday morning. &#8220;I lost about 20 yews this winter that were at least 30 years old. They&#8217;re all dead.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">It is the second time in only three years that the Midwest has suffered whiplash from spring weather extremes.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Two years ago, summerlike temperatures arrived in March, causing an unusually early bloom for cherry trees that were fooled into thinking it was spring. When a deep freeze followed, most of the cherry crop in Michigan and Wisconsin was lost.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">This spring, it has been so cool and damp that many Midwesterners have scarcely ventured out into their backyards. Patio furniture is still packed away in garages, collecting dust. Lawns have scarcely needed mowing, if at all.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;The weather has been so miserable that people haven&#8217;t been able to clear up their yards,&#8221; Nancy Hazard, the owner of <a title=\"The website.\" href=\"http://www.countrygardensperennials.com/\">Country Gardens Perennials</a> in Oconomowoc, Wis. &#8220;Business is definitely slower this year.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">At the <a title=\"The website.\" href=\"http://www.prairiepedlar.com/\">Prairie Pedlar</a> nursery in Odebolt, Iowa, the owners wrote a special message on their website for customers who were discouraged by the &#8220;challenges already mounting&#8221; for the 2014 gardening season: &#8220;Keep calm and garden on.&#8221;</p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen such a mixed-up Mother Nature,&#8221; said Jane Hogue, an owner. &#8220;It&#8217;s the most severe extremes we&#8217;ve had. People are so disappointed that they&#8217;ve lost so many plants and flowers. I&#8217;m sure there isn&#8217;t a living mum in all of northwest Iowa.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-2\">At the <a title=\"The website.\" href=\"http://www.chicagobotanic.org/\">Chicago Botanic Garden</a> in Glencoe, Ill., staff members are assessing the damage that winter has wrought, removing dead plants and pruning damaged ones.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Certain plants that were &#8220;on the edge of their hardiness&#8221; in the Great Lakes climate, like Japanese maples, did not survive. Tim Johnson, the director of horticulture, said he planned to have some of them replanted anyway.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;I hope we don&#8217;t have another winter like this one,&#8221; Mr. Johnson said. &#8220;We&#8217;re hoping it was an unusual winter.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">A regional report from the <a title=\"The association&#8217;s reports.\" href=\"http://www.garden.org/regional/report\">National Gardening Association</a> says spring gardens in the Midwest can be planted mid-March through mid-May, an estimate that gardeners this year have scoffed at.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">More than 37 million households in the United States keep gardens.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Meteorologists have suggested that the brisk temperatures could continue, with the lingering ice cover on parts of the Great Lakes chilling the air that moves above it.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Many home gardeners are skittish about putting plants in the ground at all, preferring to wait until after Memorial Day, when the chance of a nighttime frost is remote.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">But Mark Pankus, the nursery manager of <a title=\"The website.\" href=\"http://www.peschesgreenhouse.com/\">Pesche&#8217;s Greenhouse</a> in Lake Geneva, Wis., said he hoped the warm weather forecast for Mother&#8217;s Day weekend would signal to people in the Midwest that winter is finally over.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;It&#8217;s been so cold so long, but you&#8217;ve got to believe it&#8217;s finished,&#8221; he said, adding that he thought it was safe to begin spring gardening rituals, even if people are spooked by the weather. &#8220;It&#8217;s time. Dig it. Get your plant on.&#8221;</p>    \n     \n\n                 \n      \n</div>", "meta_favicon": "http://static01.nyt.com/favicon.ico", "movies": [], "updated_dateime": "2014-05-11T02:49:24", "source_id": null}

But they are part of a broader campaign to build public support for an Environmental Protection Agency rule that the White House will unveil in June.

When the topic is synthetic biology.\n\nBoth of those federal agencies turned out on May 1 to monitor the proceedings here at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u2014 and a representative from the F.B.I. even spoke. Their attendance, as well as a lively discussion about the science and ethics of synthetic biology, sheds light on how much attention is being focused on this rapidly advancing field of science.\n\nSynthetic biology, a 20-year-old engineering pursuit that tries to extend the genetic code with artificial nucleotides, promises to produce advances in medical therapies, materials and biological computing akin to animal and human cognition.\n\nThe field received new impetus this week when researchers at the Scripps Research Institute published a paper in the journal Nature, saying they had created an organism by adding artificial genetic code to its DNA \u2014 specifically, two new nucleotides that they named X and Y, in addition to the existing natural nucleotides of A, C, G and T.\n\nAs Andrew Pollack reported in The New York Times, \u201cThe accomplishment might eventually lead to organisms that can make medicines or industrial products that cells with only the natural genetic code cannot.\u201d\n\nAlicia Jackson, a former Massachusetts Institute of Technology materials scientist, presented her work in this field at the symposium, organized by the Center for Bits and Atoms, an M.I.T. research group that focuses on new design and manufacturing technologies.\n\nDr. Jackson has a new Defense Department project that she has named Living Foundries. In April, the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency underscored the significance of the project when they created an office, the Biological Technologies Office, with Dr. Jackson as deputy director.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re interested in is how to harness the power of biology to make materials,\u201d she said in her symposium presentation. \u201cThe goal of Living Foundries is to start speaking about how do we use biology to create things like polymers and catalysts as well as really new types of materials.\u201d\n\nNeil Gershenfeld, a physicist who is the director of the Center for Bits and Atoms, said that the improvement in the capacity to read and write biological genes has given rise to the possibility of \u201cspectacular advances,\u201d like the ability to use a computer to design a complete genome, output it, insert it in a cell and in effect create life from scratch.\n\nThe new abilities, he noted, raised ethical questions that are as yet unanswered.\n\n\u201cWhen the ability to convert biology to data and data into biology becomes that cheap, that agile, that easy to do, what are the consequences?\u201d he said.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe most exciting and frightening thing I saw this morning was a slide talking about designing and synthesizing genomes next to a slide describing a human being.\u201d\n\nThese kinds of concerns would explain the presence of the federal law enforcement representatives. In his own presentation, the F.B.I. agent, Carmine Nigro, bluntly warned, \u201cThese technologies do not just pose a risk to individual buildings or cities, but if cleverly deployed, can reduce our population by significant percentages.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cis a responsibility that we owe as members of the intelligence community and hope you will share with us.\u201d\n\nOther speakers included biologists, physicists, computer scientists and mechanical engineers who outlined new design techniques, applications like ones for personalized medical treatments and ambitious efforts to revive extinct species such as the passenger pigeon and the woolly mammoth.\n\nGeorge Church, a Harvard biologist and a pioneer in sequencing the human genome, spoke about what he described as the creation of \u201cradical new genomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do we want to make radical new genomes, rather than making subtle changes that might be sufficient?\u201d he asked. The advantages, he said, include the ability to design new safeguards, new virus resistance and new chemistry.\n\nJohn Glass, a member of the group at the J. Craig Venter Institute that in 2010 fabricated the first synthetic cell, described his current research.\n\n\u201cIt inspired our group to go on from this initial synthetic organism to try to build what we refer to as a \u2018true minimal cell,'\u201d he said. Building such a living organism will be an invaluable aid to deeper understanding of basic biological processes, he declared.\n\nRyan Phelan, a biotechnology entrepreneur, described the efforts of Revive and Restore, a project of the Long Now Foundation, a San Francisco nonprofit dedicated to making \u201clong-term thinking\u201d more common. The project is trying to use genetic engineering techniques to restore the passenger pigeon, a migratory bird that flocked by the billions in the United States before the turn of the last century. The species was hunted out of existence after the invention of the telegraph and railroad made it possible for humans to efficiently track the birds.\n\nShe described the increasing rate of \u201cextinction events,\u201d particularly ones affecting bird species.\n\n\u201cThe field of conservation is at a low point,\u201d she said. \u201cAll you hear is bad stories. What we\u2019re trying to do is bring an influx of technology and hope to the field of conservation.\u201d\n\nBut the risks and concerns involved in synthetic biology were made clear by an absence, as much as by the presence of the law enforcement officials and the ambitious aspirations of the scientists who presented. Huanming Yang, chairman of Beijing Genomics Institute, the world\u2019s largest sequencing research institute, was scheduled to deliver the keynote address at the event but was denied a visa by the United States government.\n\nIn his absence, the institute\u2019s research was described by Laurie Goodman, editor of Gigascience, a data science journal. She noted that the inclusion of the Chinese research group in the Human Genome Project was the first such Chinese involvement in an international scientific collaboration.\n\n\u201cTen years later, B.G.I. was one of the largest genomics research institutes in the world and now it\u2019s global,\u201d she said.\n\nThe day after the symposium, Dr. Church participated in a public conversation at the M.I.T. Media Laboratory, where he is now a visiting fellow. In contrast to the technical focus of the previous day\u2019s symposium, he discussed some of the more speculative possibilities of the new technologies.\n\nLast year, he noted, he was able to encode the text of his book about synthetic biology, \u201cRegenesis,\u201d into DNA, and then grow more than 70 million copies, in effect printing more than the sum of the 100 most popular books ever written. He said that the new method had attracted attention from archivists, who were looking for better technologies to preserve human culture. Not only does such a technique offer longer-lasting storage, but it is more than a million times denser than today\u2019s electronic storage technologies.\n\nAll in all, he said, the concerns about gene therapy are overstated.\n\n\u201cWhen it does get to the point where it is incredibly cheap to do it, it will also be incredibly cheap to reverse it, as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re augmented and we need to get used to it.\u201d", "image": null, "pub_datetime": "2014-05-09T17:28:18", "keywords": ["conference", "synthetic", "biology", "lures", "institute", "intriguing",

"article_html": "<div>\n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-1\">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. &#8212; When does a scientific conference warrant the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security? When the topic is synthetic biology.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Both of those federal agencies turned out on May 1 to monitor the proceedings here at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology &#8212; and a representative from the F.B.I. even spoke. Their attendance, as well as a lively discussion about the science and ethics of synthetic biology, sheds light on how much attention is being focused on this rapidly advancing field of science.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Synthetic biology, a 20-year-old engineering pursuit that tries to extend the genetic code with artificial nucleotides, promises to produce advances in medical therapies, materials and biological computing akin to animal and human cognition.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The field received new impetus this week when researchers at the Scripps Research Institute published a <a title=\"journal article\" href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature13314.html\">paper</a> in the journal Nature, saying they had created an organism by adding artificial genetic code to its DNA &#8212; specifically, two new nucleotides that they named X and Y, in addition to the existing natural nucleotides of A, C, G and T.</p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">As Andrew Pollack <a title=\"Times article\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/08/business/researchers-report-breakthrough-in-creating-artificial-genetic-code.html?action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Ar&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26region%3DMasthead%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26contentCollection%3DHomepage%26t%3Dqry126%23%2FDNA%2520synthetic\">reported</a> in The New York Times, &#8220;The accomplishment might eventually lead to organisms that can make medicines or industrial products that cells with only the natural genetic code cannot.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\"><a href=\"http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/BTO/Personnel/DrAliciaJackson.aspx\">Alicia Jackson</a>, a former Massachusetts Institute of Technology materials scientist, presented her work in this field at the symposium, organized by the Center for Bits and Atoms, an M.I.T. research group that focuses on new design and manufacturing technologies.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Dr. Jackson has a new Defense Department project that she has named Living Foundries. In April, the Pentagon&#8217;s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency underscored the significance of the project when they created an office, the Biological Technologies Office, with Dr. Jackson as deputy director.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-2\">&#8220;What we&#8217;re interested in is how to harness the power of biology to make materials,&#8221; she said in her symposium presentation. &#8220;The goal of Living Foundries is to start speaking about how do we use biology to create things like polymers and catalysts as well as really new types of materials.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Neil Gershenfeld, a physicist who is the director of the Center for Bits and Atoms, said that the improvement in the capacity to read and write biological genes has given rise to the possibility of &#8220;spectacular advances,&#8221; like the ability to use a computer to design a complete genome, output it, insert it in a cell and in effect create life from scratch.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The new abilities, he noted, raised ethical questions that are as yet unanswered.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;When the ability to convert biology to data and data into biology becomes that cheap, that agile, that easy to do, what are the consequences?&#8221; he said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">He added, &#8220;The most exciting and frightening thing I saw this morning was a slide talking about designing and synthesizing genomes next to a slide describing a human being.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">These kinds of concerns would explain the presence of the federal law enforcement representatives. In his own presentation, the F.B.I. agent, Carmine Nigro, bluntly warned, &#8220;These technologies do not just pose a risk to individual buildings or cities, but if cleverly deployed, can reduce our population by significant percentages.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;That,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is a responsibility that we owe as members of the intelligence community and hope you will share with us.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-3\">Other speakers included biologists, physicists, computer scientists and mechanical engineers who outlined new design techniques, applications like ones for personalized medical treatments and ambitious efforts to revive extinct species such as the passenger pigeon and the woolly mammoth.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">George Church, a Harvard biologist and a pioneer in sequencing the human genome, spoke about what he described as the creation of &#8220;radical new genomes.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;Why do we want to make radical new genomes, rather than making subtle changes that might be sufficient?&#8221; he asked. The advantages, he said, include the ability to design new safeguards, new virus resistance and new chemistry.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">John Glass, a member of the group at the J. Craig Venter Institute that in 2010 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/science/21cell.html?_r=0\">fabricated the first synthetic cell,</a> described his current research.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;It inspired our group to go on from this initial synthetic organism to try to build what we refer to as a &#8216;true minimal cell,'&#8221; he said. Building such a living organism will be an invaluable aid to deeper understanding of basic biological processes, he declared.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Ryan Phelan, a biotechnology entrepreneur, described the efforts of Revive and Restore, a project of the Long Now Foundation, a San Francisco nonprofit dedicated to making &#8220;long-term thinking&#8221; more common. The project is trying to use genetic engineering techniques to restore the passenger pigeon, a migratory bird that flocked by the billions in the United States before the turn of the last century. The species was hunted out of existence after the invention of the telegraph and railroad made it possible for humans to efficiently track the birds.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">She described the increasing rate of &#8220;extinction events,&#8221; particularly ones affecting bird species.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;The field of conservation is at a low point,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All you hear is bad stories. What we&#8217;re trying to do is bring an influx of technology and hope to the field of conservation.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">But the risks and concerns involved in synthetic biology were made clear by an absence, as much as by the presence of the law enforcement officials and the ambitious aspirations of the scientists who presented. Huanming Yang, chairman of Beijing Genomics Institute, the world&#8217;s largest sequencing research institute, was scheduled to deliver the keynote address at the event but was denied a visa by the United States government.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In his absence, the institute&#8217;s research was described by Laurie Goodman, editor of Gigascience, a data science journal. She noted that the inclusion of the Chinese research group in the Human Genome Project was the first such Chinese involvement in an international scientific collaboration.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;Ten years later, B.G.I. was one of the largest genomics research institutes in the world and now it&#8217;s global,&#8221; she said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The day after the symposium, Dr. Church participated in a public conversation at the M.I.T. Media Laboratory, where he is now a visiting fellow. In contrast to the technical focus of the previous day&#8217;s symposium, he discussed some of the more speculative possibilities of the new technologies.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Last year, he noted, he was able to encode the text of his book about synthetic biology, &#8220;Regenesis,&#8221; into DNA, and then grow more than 70 million copies, in effect printing more than the sum of the 100 most popular books ever written. He said that the new method had attracted attention from archivists, who were looking for better technologies to preserve human culture. Not only does such a technique offer longer-lasting storage, but it is more than a million times denser than today&#8217;s electronic storage technologies.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">All in all, he said, the concerns about gene therapy are overstated.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;When it does get to the point where it is incredibly cheap to do it, it will also be incredibly cheap to reverse it, as well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re augmented and we need to get used to it.&#8221;</p>    \n     \n\n                      \n</div>", "meta_favicon": "http://static01.nyt.com/favicon.ico", "movies": [], "updated_dateime": "2014-05-11T02:49:24", "source_id": null}

The bacteria that grow on the walls of its most remote recesses have been living in complete isolation for more than four million years.\n\nIn 2010, Gerry Wright, a microbiologist at McMaster University in Ontario, ran an experiment on those long-lost bacteria. He and his colleagues doused them with antibiotics, the drugs that doctors have used for the past 70 years to wipe out bacterial infections.\n\nBut many of the Lechuguilla bacteria would not die.\n\n\u201cMost of them were resistant to something,\u201d said Dr. Wright. Some strains, he and his colleagues found, could resist 14 commercially available antibiotics.\n\nDr. Wright\u2019s discovery didn\u2019t fit the conventional story of antibiotics. Antibiotics were introduced in the mid-1900s. Each time a new drug was introduced, it would take years before bacteria that could resist it became common.\n\nIn the decades since, this trend has turned into a crisis. Last week, the World Health Organization reported that antibiotic resistance is now a major threat to public health across the entire planet. \u201cWe will soon hit the wall,\u201d warned Joseph Nesme, a microbiologist at the University of Lyon in France.\n\nAt first, the antibiotics crisis seemed like a simple story of evolutionary cause and effect. Whenever bacteria reproduce, there\u2019s a tiny chance that a mutation will emerge that lets them resist an antibiotic. When we take that antibiotic, the mutant microbes can thrive while susceptible bacteria die.\n\nIf that were all there was to the story, the Lechuguilla Cave bacteria should have been easy targets. Cut off from the world, they never had a chance to evolve resistance to our drugs.\n\nBut Dr. Wright discovered that they were already prepared. They had many genes that allowed them to survive what should have been a fatal dose of antibiotics.\n\nTheir resistance hinted that antibiotic-resistance genes were not just the product of modern medicine, but an ancient part of nature.\n\nNow a new study from Mr. Nesme and his colleagues reveals just how widespread resistance is.\n\nTo carry out their study, Mr. Nesme and his colleagues took advantage of the fact that many teams of scientists are gathering huge amounts of DNA from all over the world. They\u2019ve cataloged millions of genes, and made them available in online databases.\n\nMr. Nesme and his colleagues searched the databases from 71 of those places \u2014 everywhere from Antarctic ice to the bottom of the ocean. They looked for genes that were similar to the ones that disease-causing bacteria use to resist antibiotics.\n\nAs the authors report in the journal Current Biology, they hit the jackpot. \u201cWe find them in all environments,\u201d said Mr. Nesme.\n\nDr. Wright, who was not involved in the research, said that Mr. Nesme\u2019s study confirms the work that he and his colleagues have been doing. \u201cThis paper reinforces that resistance is everywhere,\u201d he said.\n\nScientists are puzzled about why resistance genes should be so old and so widespread. If the genes didn\u2019t evolve recently to fight against modern medicine, what are they doing in other bacteria?\n\nThey\u2019re probably doing a lot of things. Bacteria make their own antibiotics, for example, which they sometimes use to fend off competitors. Some of their competitors have evolved ways to resist those deadly molecules.\n\nIn addition, some resistance genes can be found in antibiotic-producing bacteria themselves. These bacteria can defend against their own poisons. \u201cOtherwise, they make antibiotics once and commit suicide,\u201d said Dr. Wright.\n\nBut a number of studies suggest that bacteria use resistance genes for jobs that have nothing to do with antibiotics.\n\nLast week, for example, Dr. Wright and his colleagues published a study they had conducted on bacteria that live in soil. They found a gene in these bacteria that provides resistance to an antibiotic called rifamycin.\n\nOr rather, it would provide resistance if the bacteria actually used the gene. But when Dr. Wright and his colleagues exposed the bacteria to rifamycin, the gene remained silent and the bacteria died.\n\nDr. Wright suspects that the soil bacteria use the rifamycin-resistance gene to perform a different job. But what that job is, he has no idea.\n\nThe global supply of resistance genes that scientists are uncovering appears to be fueling the antibiotics crisis. That\u2019s because disease-causing bacteria can pick up resistance genes from other species and use them to fight our drugs.\n\nResistance genes can move between different species of microbes in many ways. Viruses, for example, can pick up DNA from one microbial host and then ferry it to another.\n\nIn some cases, disease-causing bacteria are simply borrowing genes that other bacteria were already using to resist antibiotics in nature. In the 1980s, for example, doctors saw an abrupt rise of bacteria resistant to the antibiotic vancomycin. Dr. Wright and his colleagues later discovered the source of their genes. They came from the very bacteria that make vancomycin in nature.\n\nIn other cases, Dr. Wright suspects, disease-causing bacteria pick up genes that other microbes used for different jobs. It just so happens that those genes can also make bacteria able to withstand to a particular antibiotic.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden you get something we recognize as resistance,\u201d said Dr. Wright.\n\nIt\u2019s sobering to realize that we\u2019re up against a planet\u2019s worth of resistance genes. But understanding our enemy is better than ignorance. Dr. Wright thinks that new antibiotics should be tested not just against the bacteria that live inside of us and make us sick. They should also be tested on bacteria living in the soil or the ocean. Scientists would discover the resistance genes that will someday threaten the usefulness of a new drug.\n\n\u201cIt would be an early warning system, so you could at least be on the lookout,\u201d he said.", "image": null, "pub_datetime": "2014-05-08T17:01:07", "keywords": ["resist", "colleagues", "antibiotic", "genes", "resistance", "antibioticresistant", "wright", "antibiotics", "germs", "diseasecausing", "dr", "bacteria", "lying", "wait"], "meta_description": "A study finds that genes that let bacteria survive drugs intended to wipe them out are widespread, even in the most isolated parts of the planet.", "thumb": null, "img": "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/08/science/zimmer-headshot/zimmer-headshot-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "title": "Matter: Antibiotic-Resistant Germs, Lying in Wait Everywhere", "img_urls": [], "updated_date": "2014-05-11", "hash": "996f126d8bcfb7f06732b5bb7f98266e7edc1739", "tags": ["Antibiotics", "Microbiology", "Genetics and Heredity", "Bacteria"], "simple_domain": "nytimes", "authors": ["Carl Zimmer"], "page_html": null, "pub_date": "2014-05-08", "slug": "c-f-s-a-b-sc-l-l-snytimes-n-c-a-c-a-c-a-cscience-cantibiotic-eresistant-egerms-elying-ein-ewait-bhtml-dpartner-frss-gemc-frss-story", "meta_lang": "en", "url": "http://rss.nytimes.com/c/34625/f/640377/s/3a34b572/sc/14/l/0L0Snytimes0N0C20A140C0A50C0A80Cscience0Cantibiotic0Eresistant0Egerms0Elying0Ein0Ewait0Bhtml0Dpartner0Frss0Gemc0Frss/story01.htm", "article_html": "<div>\n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-1\">The <a title=\"About the cave\" href=\"http://www.nps.gov/cave/naturescience/lechuguilla_cave.htm\">Lechuguilla Cave</a> in New Mexico is a network of chambers stretching 1,600 feet underground.

Base-stealers were lethargic. Pitchers were losing their aim. In the evening, outfielders were burning up as if standing under the scorching sun of the day.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Mosquito, now dead,\u201d said Arnulfo T\u00e9llez Aguilera, 49, pointing to a photograph of his smiling teammates before their muscles withered, like his. \u201cThat\u2019s my brother, Danilo, dead too.\u201d\n\nAcross Central America, a painful disease that affects the kidneys has killed at least 20,000 people over the past decade and has become the leading cause of deaths in hospitals among men in El Salvador. But the illness, often called chronic kidney disease of unknown causes, or CKDu, is so poorly understood that it still does not have a universally agreed-upon name.\n\nTheories vary drastically, citing a combination of possible factors, including heat stress, chronic dehydration, toxic chemicals, painkillers, sugar consumption and even volcanic ash.\n\nBut there is a rare point of consensus, many researchers say: Nicaragua\u2019s sugar cane heartland \u2014 in particular Chichigalpa, the town that is home to the country\u2019s largest sugar mill \u2014 has been one of the hardest hit places in the world. Cane-cutting fathers and sons in the same family have died, and seemingly healthy young men are quickly wasting away.\n\nThe Nicaraguan government, the country\u2019s sugar mills, even the World Bank, which has poured tens of millions of dollars into the sugar industry here, all say that until the mystery of the disease is solved, there is little they can do to prevent it. Now, after years of inconclusive research, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is stepping in to help with some of the most ambitious studies of the illness yet.\n\nBut the sick former sugar cane workers here have little faith that more studies will bring improvements anytime soon. The fact that the research will be funded entirely by the sugar industry is only fueling the distrust.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has clean hands,\u201d said Kristen Genovese, a lawyer who helped sick former workers file a complaint against the World Bank\u2019s lending arm in 2008 for lending $55 million to the sugar mill here, called San Antonio, without looking into the disease or the possibility that it might be connected to the industry.\n\n\u201cThe government of Nicaragua has done nothing to help these people,\u201d said Ms. Genovese, who was with the Center for International Environmental Law in Washington when she filed the complaint. And the World Bank, she argued, \u201cshould have spotted this problem, and didn\u2019t do anything about it, and continued to invest in sugar in the region.\u201d\n\nAlong the Island of the Widows, as one area next to the big sugar mill is called, the disease is such a dominant part of life that health updates sometimes replace \u201chello.\u201d\n\nBefore each harvest, workers must take blood or urine tests that measure kidney function to determine whether they will be allowed to return to the fields. In preparation, some ingest concoctions of fresh tamarind juice and linseed oil, avoid the sun and force themselves to rest. Others simply pray.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re sick they tell you, \u2018You\u2019re done here,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Aguilera, who failed the test in 2001. \u201cThey washed us away, without any kind of helping hand.\u201d\n\nThe complete dependence on the industry, whatever the risks may be, is stark. Glassy-eyed men are convinced that something in the water or the fields made them sick. Yet they are desperate to return to work, borrowing their wives\u2019 and sisters\u2019 identity numbers in a furtive attempt to stay employed. In one neighborhood, even conservative studies show that one in three men have the illness.\n\n\u201cThe sugar mill said that all of this is part of nature. But this isn\u2019t nature,\u201d said Gilma Urbina, 37, a mother of five who recently lost her husband to the disease.\n\n\u201cThe day that my husband died, he died at 6 in the morning,\u201d Ms. Urbina said. \u201cDown the block, another one died at 2. The next day, three more died.\u201d She added, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to end up without any people here.\u201d\n\nRadically different perceptions of the cause have stirred debate over who should cover the enormous costs of treating patients with the disease.\n\nMario Amador, general manager of Nicaragua\u2019s National Committee of Sugar Producers, one of the groups financing the C.D.C. studies, said the sugar cane business in Nicaragua had quadrupled over the past 10 years into a $500-million-a-year industry, supplying everything from Coca-Cola to rum makers. But he said the annual kidney exams, which he called necessary to avoid putting sick workers at additional risk, had created the false impression that the mills were linked to the disease.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any relationship between CKD and the sugar cane industry,\u201d Mr. Amador said.\n\nExecutives at the San Antonio mill in Chichigalpa say they also take the annual test, but it is rare that they fail.\n\n\u201cWe drink the water here, too,\u201d said \u00c1lvaro Berm\u00fadez Castillo, the mill\u2019s administrative director, who has been working at the mill since the 1970s.\n\nLawmakers in El Salvador and Sri Lanka, where similar kidney problems have emerged, have moved to ban certain herbicides. But few of the researchers who are focusing on Nicaragua \u2014 the country with the highest death rate from the disease, according to the Pan American Health Organization \u2014 are willing to say the answer is that simple.\n\nAgricultural chemicals alone, they say, do not explain why the disease has been detected in some Nicaraguan miners at similar rates, why women who grew up on the sugar mill\u2019s grounds have generally been unscathed, or why workers here are affected at much higher rates than people exposed to the same chemicals elsewhere. Perhaps extreme heat, dehydration, the intensity of the labor or other factors play a role, the researchers say.\n\n\u201cThe problem is, this is a silent killer,\u201d said Aurora Arag\u00f3n, a Nicaraguan researcher.\n\nResidents say they began noticing the sickness shortly after the Nicaraguan government, which had nationalized the sugar industry, returned the mills to private owners in 1992. As the operations at San Antonio rapidly expanded, driven partly by American and European appetites for sugar and a move into ethanol production, families say the cane cutters \u2014 many of whom had been born in a hospital on the mill grounds and went to a school there \u2014 grew sick in larger numbers.\n\nThe mill says it pays the government every year so that workers can receive pensions and health insurance. Without a scientifically decisive link to the disease, industry officials question why they should be responsible for more.\n\nThroughout the early 2000s, lawsuits seeking compensation from the mill mostly went nowhere. Then in 2008, a workers\u2019 group known as the Association of Chichigalpinos for Life filed the complaint against the World Bank\u2019s lending arm, known as the International Finance Corporation, which had lent the mill $55 million. The complaint alleged that by failing to acknowledge the disease in documentation about the project, it had violated its own lending standards.\n\nWhen deciding whether to invest in the industry, no one had brought up or looked into the disease, a spokesman for the finance corporation said.\n\n\u201cCKD is not a common disease in the sugar sector worldwide, so I.F.C. did not look into this issue at appraisal,\u201d said the spokesman, Aaron Rosenberg, based in Washington. The institution has lent more than $100 million to Nicaraguan sugar mills over the past decade.\n\nAfter the complaint, the mill agreed to provide food and other assistance to widows and sick workers. It also agreed to open its door to a team of outside researchers.\n\nYet \u201cnature can be very reluctant to give up its secrets,\u201d said Daniel Brooks, a researcher from Boston University, which was selected to investigate the disease by a committee that included mill executives and sick workers.\n\nFive years later, Dr. Brooks has as many questions about the disease as answers. His report published in 2012 neither entirely ruled out nor formally endorsed any theory.\n\nNow, Dr. Brooks and his team from Boston University will be leading the charge in three C.D.C. Foundation studies, which he believes could have implications far beyond Nicaragua.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if this is the tip of the iceberg yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this is heat stress and the climate is changing in the direction of getting hotter over time, are we seeing something that will happen much more in the future and maybe extend its geographic range?\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilarly, if it\u2019s agrochemicals, the agrochemicals they use are very widespread across the whole world,\u201d he added.\n\nFor now his team is more focused on two other areas: whether the disease has a genetic component and its presence in children. Research into work-related risk factors is also planned, but sugar industry funding so far covers only preliminary work.

Base-stealers were lethargic. Pitchers were losing their aim. In the evening, outfielders were burning up as if standing under the scorching sun of the day.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;That&#8217;s Mosquito, now dead,&#8221; said Arnulfo T&#233;llez Aguilera, 49, pointing to a photograph of his smiling teammates before their muscles withered, like his. &#8220;That&#8217;s my brother, Danilo, dead too.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Across Central America, a painful disease that affects the kidneys has killed at least 20,000 people over the past decade and has become the leading cause of deaths in hospitals among men in El Salvador. But the illness, often called chronic kidney disease of unknown causes, or CKDu, is so poorly understood that it still does not have a <a title=\"MEDICC Review article.\" href=\"http://www.medicc.org/mediccreview/index.php?issue=28&amp;id=347&amp;a=va\">universally agreed-upon name</a>.</p>     \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-6\">Theories vary drastically, citing a combination of possible factors, including heat stress, chronic dehydration, toxic chemicals, painkillers, sugar consumption and even volcanic ash.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">But there is a rare point of consensus, many researchers say: Nicaragua&#8217;s sugar cane heartland &#8212; in particular Chichigalpa, the town that is home to <a title=\"Mill owner&#8217;s website\" href=\"http://www.nicaraguasugar.com/en/\">the country&#8217;s largest sugar mill</a> &#8212; has been one of the hardest hit places in the world. Cane-cutting fathers and sons in the same family have died, and seemingly healthy young men are quickly wasting away.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The Nicaraguan government, the country&#8217;s sugar mills, even the World Bank, which has poured tens of millions of dollars into the sugar industry here, all say that until the mystery of the disease is solved, there is little they can do to prevent it. Now, after years of inconclusive research, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is stepping in to help with some of the most ambitious studies of the illness yet.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">But the sick former sugar cane workers here have little faith that more studies will bring improvements anytime soon. The fact that the research will be <a title=\"Article, Center for Public Integrity\" href=\"http://www.publicintegrity.org/2014/02/12/14236/cdc-launches-industry-financed-studies-deadly-kidney-disease-central-america\">funded entirely</a> by the sugar industry is only fueling the distrust.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anybody has clean hands,&#8221; said Kristen Genovese, a lawyer who helped sick former workers file a complaint against the World Bank&#8217;s lending arm in 2008 for lending $55 million to the sugar mill here, called San Antonio, without looking into the disease or the possibility that it might be connected to the industry.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;The government of Nicaragua has done nothing to help these people,&#8221; said Ms. Genovese, who was with the <a href=\"http://www.ciel.org/Staff_Bios/Genovese.html\">Center for International Environmental Law</a> in Washington when she filed the <a href=\"http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/cases/case_detail.aspx?id=82\">complaint</a>. And the World Bank, she argued, &#8220;should have spotted this problem, and didn&#8217;t do anything about it, and continued to invest in sugar in the region.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Along the Island of the Widows, as one area next to the big sugar mill is called, the disease is such a dominant part of life that health updates sometimes replace &#8220;hello.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Before each harvest, workers must take blood or urine tests that measure kidney function to determine whether they will be allowed to return to the fields. In preparation, some ingest concoctions of fresh tamarind juice and linseed oil, avoid the sun and force themselves to rest. Others simply pray.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;When you&#8217;re sick they tell you, &#8216;You&#8217;re done here,&#8217; &#8221; said Mr. Aguilera, who failed the test in 2001. &#8220;They washed us away, without any kind of helping hand.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-3\">The complete dependence on the industry, whatever the risks may be, is stark. Glassy-eyed men are convinced that something in the water or the fields made them sick. Yet they are desperate to return to work, borrowing their wives&#8217; and sisters&#8217; identity numbers in a furtive attempt to stay employed. In one neighborhood, even conservative studies show that one in three men have the illness.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;The sugar mill said that all of this is part of nature. But this isn&#8217;t nature,&#8221; said Gilma Urbina, 37, a mother of five who recently lost her husband to the disease.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-7\">&#8220;The day that my husband died, he died at 6 in the morning,&#8221; Ms. Urbina said. &#8220;Down the block, another one died at 2. The next day, three more died.&#8221; She added, &#8220;I think we&#8217;re going to end up without any people here.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Radically different perceptions of the cause have stirred debate over who should cover the enormous costs of treating patients with the disease.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Mario Amador, general manager of Nicaragua&#8217;s National Committee of Sugar Producers, one of the groups financing the C.D.C. studies, said the sugar cane business in Nicaragua had quadrupled over the past 10 years into a $500-million-a-year industry, supplying everything from Coca-Cola to rum makers. But he said the annual kidney exams, which he called necessary to avoid putting sick workers at additional risk, had created the false impression that the mills were linked to the disease.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any relationship between CKD and the sugar cane industry,&#8221; Mr. Amador said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Executives at the San Antonio mill in Chichigalpa say they also take the annual test, but it is rare that they fail.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;We drink the water here, too,&#8221; said &#193;lvaro Berm&#250;dez Castillo, the mill&#8217;s administrative director, who has been working at the mill since the 1970s.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Lawmakers in El Salvador and <a title=\"Article, Center for Public Integrity\" href=\"http://www.publicintegrity.org/2014/03/13/14418/sri-lanka-bans-monsanto-herbicide-citing-potential-link-deadly-kidney-disease\">Sri Lanka</a>, where similar kidney problems have emerged, have moved to ban certain herbicides. But few of the researchers who are focusing on Nicaragua &#8212; the country with the highest death rate from the disease, according to the Pan American Health Organization &#8212; are willing to say the answer is that simple.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Agricultural chemicals alone, they say, do not explain why the disease has been detected in some Nicaraguan miners at similar rates, why women who grew up on the sugar mill&#8217;s grounds have generally been unscathed, or why workers here are affected at much higher rates than people exposed to the same chemicals elsewhere. Perhaps extreme heat, dehydration, the intensity of the labor or other factors play a role, the researchers say.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;The problem is, this is a silent killer,&#8221; said Aurora Arag&#243;n, a Nicaraguan researcher.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-2\">Residents say they began noticing the sickness shortly after the Nicaraguan government, which had nationalized the sugar industry, <a href=\"http://assets.coca-colacompany.com/10/58/7b94d83d4c25a4a3bb5eb919649e/NicaraguaSugarIndustry-AMacroLevelReport012309.pdf\">returned</a> the mills to private owners in 1992. As the operations at San Antonio rapidly expanded, driven partly by American and European appetites for sugar and a move into ethanol production, families say the cane cutters &#8212; many of whom had been born in a hospital on the mill grounds and went to a school there &#8212; grew sick in larger numbers.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-8\">The mill says it pays the government every year so that workers can receive pensions and health insurance. Without a scientifically decisive link to the disease, industry officials question why they should be responsible for more.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-5\">Throughout the early 2000s, lawsuits seeking compensation from the mill mostly went nowhere. Then in 2008, a workers&#8217; group known as the <a title=\"ASOCHIVIDA Website\" href=\"http://www.asochivida.org.ni/index.php?lang=en\">Association of Chichigalpinos for Life</a> filed the complaint against the World Bank&#8217;s lending arm, known as the International Finance Corporation, which had lent the mill $55 million. The complaint alleged that by failing to acknowledge the disease in <a href=\"https://ifcndd.ifc.org/ifcext/spiwebsite1.nsf/78e3b305216fcdba85257a8b0075079d/082de2a692fb5a84852576ba000e32b1?opendocument\">documentation about the project</a>, it had violated its own lending standards.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-4\">When deciding whether to invest in the industry, no one had brought up or looked into the disease, a spokesman for the finance corporation said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;CKD is not a common disease in the sugar sector worldwide, so I.F.C. did not look into this issue at appraisal,&#8221; said the spokesman, Aaron Rosenberg, based in Washington. The institution has lent more than $100 million to Nicaraguan sugar mills over the past decade.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">After the complaint, the mill agreed to provide food and other <a title=\"Statement, Association of Chichigalpinos for Life\" href=\"http://www.asochivida.org.ni/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8&amp;Itemid=3&amp;lang=en\">assistance</a> to widows and sick workers. It also agreed to open its door to a team of outside researchers.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Yet &#8220;nature can be very reluctant to give up its secrets,&#8221; said Daniel Brooks, a researcher from Boston University, which was selected to investigate the disease by a committee that included mill executives and sick workers.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Five years later, Dr. Brooks has as many questions about the disease as answers. His <a title=\"PDF\" href=\"http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/cases/document-links/documents/BU_SummaryReport_August122012.pdf\">report</a> published in 2012 neither entirely ruled out nor formally endorsed any theory.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Now, Dr. Brooks and his team from Boston University will be leading the charge in three C.D.C. Foundation studies, which he believes could have implications far beyond Nicaragua.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;We don&#8217;t know if this is the tip of the iceberg yet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If this is heat stress and the climate is changing in the direction of getting hotter over time, are we seeing something that will happen much more in the future and maybe extend its geographic range?&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;Similarly, if it&#8217;s agrochemicals, the agrochemicals they use are very widespread across the whole world,&#8221; he added.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">For now his team is more focused on two other areas: whether the disease has a genetic component and its presence in children. Research into work-related risk factors is also planned, but sugar industry funding so far covers only preliminary work. The C.D.C. says that numerous measures are in place to protect the research from undue influence. Some others are suspicious.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;If your main concern is limiting liability, you are never going to get to the bottom of what is causing this,&#8221; said Jason Glaser, president of <a title=\"La Isla Foundation Website\" href=\"http://laislafoundation.org/\">La Isla Foundation</a>, an organization focused on the disease in Nicaragua.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-9\">On a recent afternoon, Mr. Aguilera was feeling well enough to take careful steps toward the graves of his two brothers and father, all victims of the disease.

{"domain": "rss.nytimes.com", "meta_keywords": ["National Cancer Institute", "Cancer", "Tumors", "Science (Journal)", "Bachini  Melinda", "Immune System"], "text": "Doctors have taken an important step toward a long-sought goal: harnessing a person\u2019s own immune system to fight cancer.\n\nAn article published Thursday in the journal Science describes the treatment of a 43-year-old woman with an advanced and deadly type of cancer that had spread from her bile duct to her liver and lungs, despite chemotherapy.\n\nResearchers at the National Cancer Institute sequenced the genome of her cancer and identified cells from her immune system that attacked a specific mutation in the malignant cells. Then they grew those immune cells in the laboratory and infused billions of them back into her bloodstream.\n\nThe tumors began \u201cmelting away,\u201d said Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, the senior author of the article and chief of the surgery branch at the cancer institute.\n\nThe woman is not cured: Her tumors are shrinking, but not gone. And an experiment on one patient cannot determine whether a new treatment works. But the report is noteworthy because it describes an approach that may also be applied to common tumors \u2014 like those in the digestive tract, ovaries, pancreas, lungs and breasts \u2014 that cause more than 80 percent of the 580,000 cancer deaths in the United States every year.\n\nDr. Rosenberg\u2019s patient, Melinda Bachini, now 45, a paramedic in Billings, Mont., who is the mother of six children, said that without the cell treatment, \u201chonest, I don\u2019t know that I would be here.\u201d\n\nDr. Rosenberg agreed, saying that in April 2012, when Ms. Bachini received the first immune treatment, her life expectancy was probably a matter of months.\n\nRelated techniques involving immune cells have brought lasting remissions for people with leukemia, a blood cancer, and the aggressive skin cancer melanoma. But until now researchers had not found a way to use the cells against the so-called solid tumors that cause so many deaths.\n\nOther researchers said the treatment used by Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s team, known as adoptive cell therapy, had promise for these common cancers. But they also cautioned that the report was early and based on just one patient.\n\nDr. Carl June, who directs similar research at the University of Pennsylvania, said the research addressed an important issue by showing that adoptive cell therapy could have an effect on commonly lethal solid tumors.\n\nAnother expert, Dr. Michel Sadelain of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said the report showed that carefully selected immune cells could be a powerful tool against bile-duct cancer. But he also said it was too soon to tell if the same approach would work for other patients or could be scaled up to treat all those who might need it.\n\nDr. Rosenberg acknowledged that there were limitations: The technique required highly sophisticated techniques in immunology, and produced a treatment tailored to only one patient. He said his team was working around the clock to streamline the process, and added, \u201cPotentially, if we could reduce the complexity, it\u2019s something that could get out into common usage eventually.\u201d\n\nResearchers have hoped for decades to find some unique marker on cancer cells, something not present on healthy cells, that could be used as a target so that cells of the immune system could home in on it and leave the good ones alone.\n\nThe goal has been elusive, but Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s team has helped some patients with melanoma by treating them with immune cells \u2014 a type of T cell called a tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte \u2014 that were extracted from samples of the patients\u2019 tumors. The team decided to study whether this type of T cell could help people with other types of cancer.\n\nMs. Bachini learned in 2009 that she had bile-duct cancer, or cholangiocarcinoma. It had already spread to her liver. She had surgery to remove about two-thirds of her liver, but within a few months the disease had turned up in her lungs. She went through one grueling regimen of chemotherapy, then another. She had nerve damage, nausea and hearing loss from the drugs. Her tumors began growing again. She started to cough.\n\n\u201cI knew chemotherapy was not going to kill this,\u201d she said. She quit the drugs.\n\nSearching the Internet for clinical trials, she came across Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s T cell study.\n\n\u201cI looked at my husband and said, \u2018This is what I want to do,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Bachini said.\n\nIn March 2012, Dr. Rosenberg\u2019s team removed tumors from her lungs to extract tumor-infiltrating T cells, then cultured the cells in a lab. A month later, Ms. Bachini was given chemotherapy to wipe out her immune system, and more than 42 billion T cells were infused through an intravenous line. She was also given a drug called interleukin-2, which helps activate T cells.\n\nThe treatment was arduous: The chemotherapy left her vomiting, weak and bald, and the interleukin-2 made her swell up with fluid.\n\nBy the end of April 2012, her cough was gone and her strength returning. She went back to the cancer institute once a month for checkups. The study, paid for by the government, was free, even including her airfare.\n\n\u201cLife was good,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything kept shrinking.\u201d\n\nBut by last summer, the lung tumors were growing again.\n\nBy then, the team had sequenced the genome of her cancer, and done extensive studies on her immune system. And it had found what researchers had long hoped for: a mutation in the cancer that was unique to it and not found in normal cells, and a type of T cell that would attack the mutation. Tests revealed that only 25 percent of the T cells that had been given to Ms. Bachini were of this specialized type.\n\nAgain, the team cultured Ms. Bachini\u2019s T cells, but this time it used only the ones that would go after the mutation. In October, she received more than 120 billion T cells, 95 percent of which were the highly specific ones.\n\nHer tumors quickly began shrinking, and have continued to do so for the past six months, Dr. Rosenberg said.\n\nMs. Bachini said she was grateful for every day. She walks her dog, a 140-pound Labrador, two miles a day, and said she was constantly on the run with three teenage daughters still at home.\n\n\u201cI pretty much can do anything I want,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Rosenberg said that his team would check up on her every two months, and that if the tumors started growing, it might be possible to treat her again. As for her long-term outlook, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, he said, the team has identified unique mutations and T cells ready to attack them in two of three other patients with cancer in the gastrointestinal tract.

person&#8217;s own immune system to fight cancer.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">An <a title=\"Abstract of the report\" href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/344/6184/641.abstract\">article published Thursday</a> in the journal Science describes the treatment of a 43-year-old woman with an advanced and deadly type of cancer that had spread from her bile duct to her liver and lungs, despite chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Researchers at the National Cancer Institute sequenced the genome of her cancer and identified cells from her immune system that attacked a specific mutation in the malignant cells. Then they grew those immune cells in the laboratory and infused billions of them back into her bloodstream.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The tumors began &#8220;melting away,&#8221; said Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, the senior author of the article and chief of the surgery branch at the cancer institute.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The woman is not cured: Her tumors are shrinking, but not gone. And an experiment on one patient cannot determine whether a new treatment works. But the report is noteworthy because it describes an approach that may also be applied to common tumors &#8212; like those in the digestive tract, ovaries, pancreas, lungs and breasts &#8212; that cause more than 80 percent of the 580,000 cancer deaths in the United States every year.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Dr. Rosenberg&#8217;s patient, Melinda Bachini, now 45, a paramedic in Billings, Mont., who is the mother of six children, said that without the cell treatment, &#8220;honest, I don&#8217;t know that I would be here.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Dr. Rosenberg agreed, saying that in April 2012, when Ms. Bachini received the first immune treatment, her life expectancy was probably a matter of months.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\"><a title=\"Times article about another type of immune therapy.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/health/13gene.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;module=Search&amp;amp;region=searchResults&amp;amp;mabReward=relbias%3Aw&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26region%3DMasthead%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26contentCollection%3DHomepage%26t%3Dqry892%23%2Fcarl%2520june&amp;amp;_r=0\">Related techniques</a> involving immune cells have brought <a title=\"Times article about another type of immune therapy.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/health/altered-t-cell-therapy-shows-promise-for-acute-leukemia.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Search&amp;amp;region=searchResults&amp;amp;mabReward=relbias%3Aw&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26region%3DMasthead%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26contentCollection%3DHomepage%26t%3Dqry468%23%2Fsadelain\">lasting remissions</a> for people with leukemia, a blood cancer, and the aggressive skin cancer <a title=\"A bulletin from the National Cancer Institute about Dr. Rosenberg&#8217;s research.\" href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/050112/page4\">melanoma</a>. But until now researchers had not found a way to use the cells against the so-called solid tumors that cause so many deaths.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-2\">Other researchers said the treatment used by Dr. Rosenberg&#8217;s team, known as adoptive cell therapy, had promise for these common cancers. But they also cautioned that the report was early and based on just one patient.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Dr. Carl June, who directs similar research at the University of Pennsylvania, said the research addressed an important issue by showing that adoptive cell therapy could have an effect on commonly lethal solid tumors.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Another expert, Dr. Michel Sadelain of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said the report showed that carefully selected immune cells could be a powerful tool against bile-duct cancer. But he also said it was too soon to tell if the same approach would work for other patients or could be scaled up to treat all those who might need it.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Dr. Rosenberg acknowledged that there were limitations: The technique required highly sophisticated techniques in immunology, and produced a treatment tailored to only one patient. He said his team was working around the clock to streamline the process, and added, &#8220;Potentially, if we could reduce the complexity, it&#8217;s something that could get out into common usage eventually.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Researchers have hoped for decades to find some unique marker on cancer cells, something not present on healthy cells, that could be used as a target so that cells of the immune system could home in on it and leave the good ones alone.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-3\">The goal has been elusive, but Dr. Rosenberg&#8217;s team has helped some patients with melanoma by treating them with immune cells &#8212; a type of T cell called a tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte &#8212; that were extracted from samples of the patients&#8217; tumors. The team decided to study whether this type of T cell could help people with other types of cancer.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Ms. Bachini learned in 2009 that she had bile-duct cancer, or cholangiocarcinoma. It had already spread to her liver. She had surgery to remove about two-thirds of her liver, but within a few months the disease had turned up in her lungs. She went through one grueling regimen of chemotherapy, then another. She had nerve damage, nausea and hearing loss from the drugs. Her tumors began growing again. She started to cough.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;I knew chemotherapy was not going to kill this,&#8221; she said. She quit the drugs.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Searching the Internet for clinical trials, she came across Dr. Rosenberg&#8217;s T cell <a title=\"About the study\" href=\"http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01174121\">study</a>.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;I looked at my husband and said, &#8216;This is what I want to do,&#8217;&#160;&#8221; Ms. Bachini said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In March 2012, Dr. Rosenberg&#8217;s team removed tumors from her lungs to extract tumor-infiltrating T cells, then cultured the cells in a lab. A month later, Ms. Bachini was given chemotherapy to wipe out her immune system, and more than 42 billion T cells were infused through an intravenous line. She was also given a drug called interleukin-2, which helps activate T cells.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The treatment was arduous: The chemotherapy left her vomiting, weak and bald, and the interleukin-2 made her swell up with fluid.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">By the end of April 2012, her cough was gone and her strength returning. She went back to the cancer institute once a month for checkups. The study, paid for by the government, was free, even including her airfare.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;Life was good,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Everything kept shrinking.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">But by last summer, the lung tumors were growing again.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">By then, the team had sequenced the genome of her cancer, and done extensive studies on her immune system. And it had found what researchers had long hoped for: a mutation in the cancer that was unique to it and not found in normal cells, and a type of T cell that would attack the mutation. Tests revealed that only 25 percent of the T cells that had been given to Ms. Bachini were of this specialized type.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Again, the team cultured Ms. Bachini&#8217;s T cells, but this time it used only the ones that would go after the mutation. In October, she received more than 120 billion T cells, 95 percent of which were the highly specific ones.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Her tumors quickly began shrinking, and have continued to do so for the past six months, Dr. Rosenberg said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Ms. Bachini said she was grateful for every day. She walks her dog, a 140-pound Labrador, two miles a day, and said she was constantly on the run with three teenage daughters still at home.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;I pretty much can do anything I want,&#8221; she said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Dr. Rosenberg said that his team would check up on her every two months, and that if the tumors started growing, it might be possible to treat her again. As for her long-term outlook, he said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll just have to wait and see.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In the meantime, he said, the team has identified unique mutations and T cells ready to attack them in two of three other patients with cancer in the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment plans are underway.</p>    \n     \n\n              \n</div>", "meta_favicon": "http://static01.nyt.com/favicon.ico", "movies": [], "updated_dateime": "2014-05-11T02:49:24", "source_id": null}

That was one of the highest levels recorded in Asia on Thursday, and twice as high as Beijing\u2019s peak for the morning, according to a post on a Twitter account about Beijing pollution maintained by the United States Embassy there.\n\nPM 2.5 refers to particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, which is believed to pose the greatest health risk because it penetrates deeply into lungs.\n\nIn Beijing, a pollution level as high as Delhi\u2019s would most likely have caused widespread concern. But in Delhi, almost no one seemed to notice. Few people here wear the filter masks that have been appearing on the streets of Beijing, and even among the wealthy, few own air purifiers, which are used widely in East Asia, because few are even aware of the problem.\n\nIndia is in the midst of national elections, but air pollution is rarely mentioned by leading politicians. At a recent embassy party here, several people expressed astonishment that New Delhi\u2019s air was considered dangerous. One of the guests, a marathon runner who jogs through Delhi\u2019s streets daily, said she had never noticed any problem with the air.\n\nThe W.H.O. report, which examined pollution levels in nearly 1,600 cities in 91 countries for the years 2008 to 2013, found that the annual mean for PM 2.5 concentrations in Delhi was 153 micrograms per cubic meter. The cities of Patna, Gwalior and Raipur followed Delhi for the worst air pollution readings. Delhi\u2019s reading was almost three times that of Beijing, whose annual mean in the report was 59.\n\nAn article in The New York Times in January reporting that PM 2.5 levels in Delhi were at least twice as bad as Beijing\u2019s led to weeks of pollution headlines in India\u2019s largest newspapers and fierce denials by government officials.\n\nGufran Beig of India\u2019s state-run System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research said Thursday in an interview that the annual mean provided for Delhi in the W.H.O. report was incorrect.\n\n\u201cOur levels are comparable with those of other cities,\u201d he said. \u201cDelhi\u2019s air quality is better than Beijing\u2019s in summer and much better in monsoon season.\u201d\n\nA host of other officials, including the chairman of the Central Pollution Control Board, were either unavailable for comment on Thursday or said they were not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.\n\nAir pollution killed about seven million people globally in 2012, making it the world\u2019s biggest environmental health risk, the W.H.O. reported last month. About 80 percent of those deaths came from heart attacks and strokes, although air pollution also increases lung cancer deaths.\n\nDr. Carlos Dora, the coordinator of health and environment at the W.H.O., said most Asians should be concerned.\n\n\u201cThe levels of air quality which we see in India, Pakistan, Iran and China are very worrying,\u201d he said. \u201cAir pollution has a huge impact on human health.\u201d\n\nThe W.H.O. study found that in the cities that had provided data for a similar but smaller study in 2011, air quality had mostly deteriorated in the intervening years. The growing use of coal-fired power plants, cars and dung fuel for cooking is one of the principal causes of worsening air pollution, the organization said.\n\nChina\u2019s extensive pollution problems have grown out of efforts by the country\u2019s leaders to develop manufacturing and industrial capacity no matter the cost. But India has little to show for its toxic air. The country\u2019s economy is sputtering, its small manufacturing sector has been shrinking, and efforts to build roads and open coal and metal mines have foundered on corruption and environmental concerns. Pakistan, which had three cities among the world\u2019s 10 most polluted, has even less to show for its pollution levels, as economic growth there has been well below India\u2019s for decades.\n\nDr. Anurag Agrawal, a pulmonary physician and researcher based in New Delhi, said he had seen a patient on Wednesday whose asthma had become so bad in recent years that he must take high doses of steroids to keep it under control. But when he leaves India, his symptoms disappear.\n\n\u201cSo I told him that he should seriously consider changing the place he lived,\u201d Dr. Agrawal said. \u201cAnd he said he would not even consider moving.\u201d", "image": null, "pub_datetime": "2014-05-08T18:01:07", "keywords": ["beijing", "25", "air", "delhi", "india", "polluted", "levels", "health", "delhis", "cities", "pollution"],

Delhi&#8217;s reading was almost three times that of Beijing, whose annual mean in the report was 59.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">An article in The New York Times <a title=\"Times article.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/world/asia/beijings-air-would-be-step-up-for-smoggy-delhi.html?action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Aw%2C%5B%22RI%3A1%22%2C%22RI%3A3%22%5D&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26contentCollection%3DEurope%26region%3DTopBar%26WT.nav%3DsearchWidget%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26pgtype%3Darticle%23%2F%2522New%2520Delhi%2522%2520pollution\">in January</a> reporting that PM 2.5 levels in Delhi were at least twice as bad as Beijing&#8217;s led to weeks of pollution headlines in India&#8217;s largest newspapers and fierce denials by government officials.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Gufran Beig of India&#8217;s state-run System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research said Thursday in an interview that the annual mean provided for Delhi in the W.H.O. report was incorrect.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;Our levels are comparable with those of other cities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Delhi&#8217;s air quality is better than Beijing&#8217;s in summer and much better in monsoon season.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">A host of other officials, including the chairman of the Central Pollution Control Board, were either unavailable for comment on Thursday or said they were not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-2\">Air pollution killed about seven million people globally in 2012, making it the world&#8217;s biggest environmental health risk, the W.H.O. reported last month. About 80 percent of those deaths came from heart attacks and strokes, although air pollution also increases lung cancer deaths.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Dr. Carlos Dora, the coordinator of health and environment at the W.H.O., said most Asians should be concerned.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;The levels of air quality which we see in India, Pakistan, Iran and China are very worrying,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Air pollution has a huge impact on human health.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The W.H.O. study found that in the cities that had provided data for a similar but smaller study in 2011, air quality had mostly deteriorated in the intervening years. The growing use of coal-fired power plants, cars and dung fuel for cooking is one of the principal causes of worsening air pollution, the organization said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">China&#8217;s extensive pollution problems have grown out of efforts by the country&#8217;s leaders to develop manufacturing and industrial capacity no matter the cost. But India has little to show for its toxic air. The country&#8217;s economy is sputtering, its small manufacturing sector has been shrinking, and efforts to build roads and open coal and metal mines have foundered on corruption and environmental concerns. Pakistan, which had three cities among the world&#8217;s 10 most polluted, has even less to show for its pollution levels, as economic growth there has been well below India&#8217;s for decades.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Dr. Anurag Agrawal, a pulmonary physician and researcher based in New Delhi, said he had seen a patient on Wednesday whose asthma had become so bad in recent years that he must take high doses of steroids to keep it under control.

{"domain": "rss.nytimes.com", "meta_keywords": ["Rationing and Allocation of Resources", "Santa Cruz (Calif)", "Water", "California", "Drought", "Conservation of Resources"], "text": "SANTA CRUZ, Calif. \u2014 The municipal water utility in this city, home to wide beaches, sun-kissed weekend getaways and evocative alternative scholarship, just got tough. Last week it started rationing water \u2014 for nonfarmers, the most draconian response to date to California\u2019s debilitating drought.\n\nThe message to customers: Use more than your allotment, and it will cost you. A lot. Water bills below the allocation run $40 or so. Go above it, and fines pegged to the amount of excess water used will quickly double, triple or quadruple that bill.\n\n\u201cWe live in a state where water supplies that are there 100 percent of the time, with 100 percent of reliability, don\u2019t exist,\u201d said Toby Goddard, the administrative services manager for the Santa Cruz Water Department. \u201cIt would be shortsighted of a utility to sell all it has to you now and not have anything for you a year out.\u201d\n\nSanta Cruz, whose fresh water supplies come from the shrinking San Lorenzo River and a small reservoir, has gone further than other strapped utilities in embracing the idea of rationing, with fines for those who exceed their allotted shares. But other utilities around the state now have a tiered pricing system. Basic water use comes cheap. Consumption that is compatible with modest landscaping comes at a slightly higher cost. Excessive use comes at premium prices.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s utilities, like the East Bay Municipal Utility District near San Francisco or the Eastern Municipal Water District in Southern California\u2019s sprawling Inland Empire, use their bills to drive home the ethic of conservation. \u201cThirty years ago, everybody took costs and divided by anticipated sales and found an average rate,\u201d said Tim Quinn, the head of the Association of California Water Agencies, or ACWA.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t lived in that world for over 30 years.\u201d\n\nDuring that time, Mr. Quinn said, utilities worked to change the equipment in people\u2019s homes, backing building-code requirements for low-flow toilets, water-restricting shower heads, and washing machines and dishwashers with low water consumption. \u201cNow we\u2019re trying to change behavior,\u201d he said.\n\nThe message irritates some people, particularly those with mansions surrounded by lush lawns and ornamental plantings. One person from a district just south of here was playing golf with Mr. Quinn at a Monterey country club recently. When he learned that his golf partner worked in water services, the man complained bitterly about his $5,000 monthly bill. Mr. Quinn replied, \u201cI think your water agency is trying to tell you something.\u201d\n\nIn some places, that message has become more personal. Starting about two decades ago, in water districts in Southern California like Irvine Ranch and San Juan Capistrano, rate-setters decided that the fairest way to encourage conservation was to assess how much each individual account needed and then to set tiers. A family with six children needed more essential water than a family with two; a house in a warm, dry microclimate needed more than a house shrouded in fog.\n\nThis process of water \u201cbudgeting\u201d is now in place in 20 of the more than 700 California water districts, and it is spreading fast. \u201cIt\u2019s what everyone is shifting toward,\u201d said Abby Figueroa, a spokeswoman for the East Bay Municipal Utility District.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s based on efficiency. Those who are inefficient pay more,\u201d said Paul D. Jones II, the general manager of the Eastern Municipal Water District.\n\nWater budgeting, known in the industry as \u201callocation pricing,\u201d may violate California law, which requires that the cost of a government service like water delivery be based on the cost of providing the service. But its cousin, tiered pricing, has suffered a legal setback. In August, an Orange County judge ruled that San Juan Capistrano\u2019s water agency had not sufficiently tied its establishment of water tiers to the cost of serving those tiers.\n\nThe consulting firm Raftelis Financial Consultants is working with the agency to establish a legally defensible link between the newly adjusted tiered pricing and the cost of providing pipes, water storage and other services. Sanjay Gaur, a manager for Raftelis, said that, in general, as monthly water bills around the state had increased to almost $50 from about $30, customers were noticing.\n\n\u201cThe water industry in the past has been hidden \u2014 people didn\u2019t know where they got their water,\u201d Mr. Gaur said. \u201cNow, because of the drought, things are going to another level. People are going to pay more attention.\u201d\n\nIn Santa Cruz, they have been paying attention for years. Conservation has been a way of life here for a generation, since a bad drought in the late 1980s. Now, in the summer months, the Santa Cruz water district sends, on average, a total of 188 million gallons a month to its 21,700 residential customers \u2014 94,000 people. In the winter months, it sends 131 million gallons.\n\nThese amounts represent about a 30 percent drop from what was used in 1987, before the last major drought. Paradoxically, conservation has been so ingrained, Mr. Goddard said, that it is difficult for customers to find ways to save more. The new limit on monthly residential use is less than 7,500 gallons.\n\nLocal residents want to help \u2014 though they may not want to pay more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve used too much water for too long. We\u2019ve become wasteful,\u201d said Marilyn Berg, 76, who with her husband, Joe, owns a three-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath, two-story home in town that is frequently rented.\n\nAre the new fines fair? \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Mr. Berg said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair, but it\u2019s tough,\u201d Mrs. Berg added. \u201cThey are hitting our pocketbooks pretty hard.\u201d", "image": null, "pub_datetime": "2014-05-09T00:01:54", "keywords": ["santa", "customers", "municipal", "district", "cruz", "water", "start", "draining", "cost", "spigots", "pricing", "pockets", "mr", "california"], "meta_description": "To encourage conservation, districts have been rationing water and imposing fines that will quickly double, triple or quadruple typical water bills.

"article_html": "<div>\n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-1\">SANTA CRUZ, Calif. &#8212; The municipal water utility in this city, home to wide beaches, sun-kissed weekend getaways and evocative alternative scholarship, just got tough. Last week it started rationing water &#8212; for nonfarmers, the most draconian response to date to California&#8217;s debilitating drought.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The message to customers: Use more than your allotment, and it will cost you. A lot. Water bills below the allocation run $40 or so. Go above it, and fines pegged to the amount of excess water used will quickly double, triple or quadruple that bill.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;We live in a state where water supplies that are there 100 percent of the time, with 100 percent of reliability, don&#8217;t exist,&#8221; said Toby Goddard, the administrative services manager for the Santa Cruz Water Department. &#8220;It would be shortsighted of a utility to sell all it has to you now and not have anything for you a year out.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Santa Cruz, whose fresh water supplies come from the shrinking San Lorenzo River and a small reservoir, has gone further than other strapped utilities in embracing the idea of rationing, with fines for those who exceed their allotted shares. But other utilities around the state now have a tiered pricing system. Basic water use comes cheap. Consumption that is compatible with modest landscaping comes at a slightly higher cost. Excessive use comes at premium prices.</p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">California&#8217;s utilities, like the East Bay Municipal Utility District near San Francisco or the Eastern Municipal Water District in Southern California&#8217;s sprawling Inland Empire, use their bills to drive home the ethic of conservation. &#8220;Thirty years ago, everybody took costs and divided by anticipated sales and found an average rate,&#8221; said Tim Quinn, the head of the Association of California Water Agencies, or ACWA.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;We haven&#8217;t lived in that world for over 30 years.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">During that time, Mr. Quinn said, utilities worked to change the equipment in people&#8217;s homes, backing building-code requirements for low-flow toilets, water-restricting shower heads, and washing machines and dishwashers with low water consumption. &#8220;Now we&#8217;re trying to change behavior,&#8221; he said.</p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The message irritates some people, particularly those with mansions surrounded by lush lawns and ornamental plantings. One person from a district just south of here was playing golf with Mr. Quinn at a Monterey country club recently. When he learned that his golf partner worked in water services, the man complained bitterly about his $5,000 monthly bill. Mr. Quinn replied, &#8220;I think your water agency is trying to tell you something.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In some places, that message has become more personal. Starting about two decades ago, in water districts in Southern California like Irvine Ranch and San Juan Capistrano, rate-setters decided that the fairest way to encourage conservation was to assess how much each individual account needed and then to set tiers. A family with six children needed more essential water than a family with two; a house in a warm, dry microclimate needed more than a house shrouded in fog.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">This process of water &#8220;budgeting&#8221; is now in place in 20 of the more than 700 California water districts, and it is spreading fast. &#8220;It&#8217;s what everyone is shifting toward,&#8221; said Abby Figueroa, a spokeswoman for the East Bay Municipal Utility District.</p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;It&#8217;s based on efficiency. Those who are inefficient pay more,&#8221; said Paul D. Jones II, the general manager of the Eastern Municipal Water District.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-2\">Water budgeting, known in the industry as &#8220;allocation pricing,&#8221; may violate California law, which requires that the cost of a government service like water delivery be based on the cost of providing the service. But its cousin, tiered pricing, has suffered a legal setback. In August, an Orange County judge ruled that San Juan Capistrano&#8217;s water agency had not sufficiently tied its establishment of water tiers to the cost of serving those tiers.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The consulting firm Raftelis Financial Consultants is working with the agency to establish a legally defensible link between the newly adjusted tiered pricing and the cost of providing pipes, water storage and other services. Sanjay Gaur, a manager for Raftelis, said that, in general, as monthly water bills around the state had increased to almost $50 from about $30, customers were noticing.</p> \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;The water industry in the past has been hidden &#8212; people didn&#8217;t know where they got their water,&#8221; Mr. Gaur said. &#8220;Now, because of the drought, things are going to another level. People are going to pay more attention.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In Santa Cruz, they have been paying attention for years. Conservation has been a way of life here for a generation, since a bad drought in the late 1980s. Now, in the summer months, the Santa Cruz water district sends, on average, a total of 188 million gallons a month to its 21,700 residential customers &#8212; 94,000 people. In the winter months, it sends 131 million gallons.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">These amounts represent about a 30 percent drop from what was used in 1987, before the last major drought. Paradoxically, conservation has been so ingrained, Mr. Goddard said, that it is difficult for customers to find ways to save more. The new limit on monthly residential use is less than 7,500 gallons.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Local residents want to help &#8212; though they may not want to pay more.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;We&#8217;ve used too much water for too long. We&#8217;ve become wasteful,&#8221; said Marilyn Berg, 76, who with her husband, Joe, owns a three-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath, two-story home in town that is frequently rented.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Are the new fines fair? &#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; Mr. Berg said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;It&#8217;s fair, but it&#8217;s tough,&#8221; Mrs. Berg added. &#8220;They are hitting our pocketbooks pretty hard.&#8221;</p>    \n     \n\n              \n</div>", "meta_favicon": "http://static01.nyt.com/favicon.ico", "movies": [], "updated_dateime": "2014-05-11T02:49:24", "source_id": null}

If so, giving them accurate information might change their minds about protecting their children against communicable diseases like measles \u2014 a near-eradicated disease that has flared anew.\n\nThat\u2019s apparently the assumption behind the educational mandates that some states are creating or considering for parents who want exemptions from vaccine requirements.\n\nBut I recently conducted a study with several colleagues in which we found that parents with mixed or negative feelings toward vaccines actually became less likely to say they would vaccinate a future child after receiving information debunking the myth that vaccines cause autism.\n\nSurprising as this may seem, our finding is consistent with a great deal of research on how people react to their beliefs being challenged. People frequently resist information that contradicts their views, such as corrective information\u2014 for example, by bringing to mind reasons to maintain their belief \u2014 and in some cases actually end up believing it more strongly as a result.\n\nTo find out if this pattern holds for vaccines, my colleagues Jason Reifler, Sean Richey, Gary Freed and I surveyed a nationally representative group of parents with children living at home in 2011, randomly assigning some to get scientific information debunking the vaccine-autism link or other pro-vaccine messages, and others to a control group.\n\nThe problem in this case wasn\u2019t getting parents to believe the facts. Our results indicate that parents who saw the corrective information were less likely to believe in the vaccines-autism myth than those who didn\u2019t. It seems that raising the topic may have instead prompted skeptical parents to think of other concerns or hesitations they have about vaccines to defend their views on the topic.\n\nIn addition, our results show that other types of messages used by public health agencies \u2014 information about disease risks, a dramatic narrative and images of sick children \u2014 were also ineffective.\n\nThese findings, which were recently published in the journal Pediatrics, suggest some caution is necessary among those proposing parental educational mandates, which were recently enacted in Oregon.\n\nThe sorts of beliefs that contribute to high vaccine exemption rates in some states aren\u2019t necessarily about facts at all and can\u2019t be easily legislated away.\n\nA more promising approach would require parents to consult with their health care provider, as the Oregon law also allows them to do. Parents name their children\u2019s doctor as their most trusted source of vaccine information. That trust might allow doctors to do what evidence alone cannot: persuade parents to protect their children as well as yours and mine.", "image": null, "pub_datetime": "2014-05-08T14:24:58",

{"domain": "rss.nytimes.com", "meta_keywords": ["Roman Catholic Church", "Birth Control and Family Planning", "Vatican City", "Francis", "Sustainable Living", "Religion and Belief", "Population"], "text": "VATICAN CITY \u2014 For four long days, several dozen physical, environmental and social scientists hunkered here with theologians, philosophers, economists and a poverty campaigner to explore ways to balance human ambitions with the planet\u2019s limits. The rare joint meeting of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences \u2014 \u201cSustainable Humanity, Sustainable Nature, Our Responsibility\u201d \u2014 helped demarcate where science leaves off and the rest of society, including organized religion, plays a role in shaping the quality of human life and environmental conditions in this century.\n\nA subtext, of course, was that Pope Francis, who made time to meet briefly with the participants for photographs and a short chat, is working on a possible encyclical letter on the environment and sustainable development. (The columnist John L. Allen, Jr., provides some helpful background in the Boston Globe.)\n\nPresentations focused on deepening inequality, the evidence for dangerous climate change, population trends, urban problems, new economic models and more. [There's a problem with the link to the presentations; I'll add it here when it's working.]\n\nAlthough this meeting was planned before Francis was selected, many participants were hoping some of the themes might influence that document, particularly with the United Nations closing in on a set of Sustainable Development Goals and a fresh effort to negotiate a new climate treaty coming to a head in late 2015. On hand were some remarkable people, including four Nobel laureates.\n\nI was invited to present a summary of my impressions as the meeting drew to a close tonight. I found much to be optimistic about. You can watch my remarks on YouTube or read them below as prepared for the interpreters and participants.\n\nFor a different take on the climate challenge, watch Naomi Oreskes, the Harvard historian*, describe her research on scientists as sentinels and her new book of fictional future climate history, \u201cThe Collapse of Western Civilization: A View from the Future,\u201d co-written with Erik M. Conway. [Her section begins at 11:10:50.]\n\nHere\u2019s the text of my remarks, which I titled \u201cCharting a Sustainable Human Journey \u2013 The Roles of Data, Values, Will and Love\u201d:\n\n\n\nIt was a great honor to be invited to attend this remarkable workshop, and it is a more humbling honor to be invited now to reflect on these remarkable presentations and conversations \u2014 spanning a range of fields from glaciology to psychology and a range of experience from that of a 96-year-old oceanographer to that of a 30-year-old advocate for street workers.\n\nAs a generalist informed by three decades of reporting on the interface of science and society, from the North Pole to the Amazon, I approach this task with the advice of the Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann in mind.\n\nWhen faced with complex problems, he has said, the wisest course is to take a \u201ccrude look at the whole.\u201d That\u2019s what I\u2019ll attempt to do.\n\nIn convening experts from across the natural and social sciences under the mantle of one of the world\u2019s great faiths, Chancellor Sorondo and the other organizers have beautifully reflected the realities underpinning our species\u2019 challenge at the dawn of an era of Earth history that is increasingly under our influence.\n\nThat Pope Francis chose to greet us today reflects his passion for harmonizing human relations and our relationship with this living planet. In this focus, the Pope is building on a foundation laid by Saint Francis, who \u2013 as several here have noted \u2013called creatures and creation kin.\n\nOur predicament in an age some have named for us \u2014 the Anthropocene \u2014 was nicely captured by Cardinal \u00d3scar Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga on the first day here when he said, \u201cNowadays man finds himself to be a technical giant and an ethical child.\u201d\n\nHumanity, in essence, is in a race between potency and awareness. The outcome will determine the quality of our species\u2019 journey and will leave an indelible mark, for better or worse, on the planet we inhabit.\n\nA few years ago, I proposed that we are experiencing \u201cpuberty on the scale of a planet.\u201d Global trends echo that awkward, sometimes damaging, transition from teenage-style ebullience to the more measured norms of adulthood.\n\nAnd just as a teenager resists calls from elders to grow up, societies \u2013 only naturally \u2013 have been initially resistant to scientists\u2019 warnings of irreversible damage to the planet\u2019s biological patrimony, risks attending unabated climate change and long-distance impacts of consumptive resource appetites.\n\nIn many ways, science has done its job.\n\nThe physical and biological sciences, along with revolutionary advances in technology \u2013 from satellites to supercomputers \u2013 have provided a clarifying picture of human-driven environmental changes.\n\nPsychological studies* and surveys have revealed deeply ingrained human traits, many shaped by our evolutionary history as a \u201chere and now\u201d species, that prevent us from acting rationally in the face of threats with long time scales, dispersed impacts and inherent complexity.\n\nPossible paths have been delineated in recent decades using ever more sophisticated models.\n\nBut that is where science\u2019s task ends. It is up to individuals and societies to choose which paths to pursue.\n\nThat is why the Roman Catholic Church \u2014 with its global reach, the ethical framework in its social justice teachings and, as with all great religions, the ability to reach hearts as well as minds \u2014 can play a valuable role in this consequential century.\n\nThis is particularly true for planet-scale problems like human-driven climate change, in which governments tend to put national interests ahead of planet-scale interests.\n\nDecisions at the scale of cities, towns, school boards, corporate boards \u2013 even households \u2013 will, in a cumulative way, be enormously influential and are more apt to be directly shaped by the worldviews and priorities of individuals.\n\nIn a prismatic way, those gathered here have made the compelling case that it is a combination of knowledge, faith, will and love that will determine the quality of the human journey in this consequential and complicated century.\n\nYes, love. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More on that in a moment.\n\nOf course, as so many of the participants have conveyed, sustaining humanity on a verdant planet is not an either/or choice.\n\nWhile data matter enormously, number crunching will not determine the resulting balance.\n\nWhile choices are shaped by values, values are shaped by upbringing and experience. That means there is room for positive change, particularly through commerce in ideas and information.\n\nAs Nancy Knowlton explained in the context of the ailing oceans, revealed connections between causes and effects, together with empathy and a menu of solutions, can spark shifts in behavior.\n\nBut the commitment to remain true to a choice and to pursue it through thick and thin requires more than values. It is a function of individual and communal will, as well, as Archbishop Minnerath aptly noted.\n\nThe research and ideas presented here revealed another important reality. Given the variegated nature of cultures, worldviews and conditions around the world, it\u2019s clear that humanity will follow many paths in the decades ahead.\n\nCalls for global and enforceable standards are creditable, but face huge hurdles.\n\nJust consider Stefano Zamagni\u2019s point about the many different forms of ethics in different countries, or Professor Schellnhuber\u2019s description of the wickedly complex array of interests and development stages perennially clashing in climate treaty negotiations.\n\nAnother reality is that global environmental and social challenges are not the work of a single generation, not problem to fix \u2013 but issues to work on perennially as a normal part of how we live and develop.\n\nI\u2019ve written before that what the world needs is an improbable mix of \u201curgency and patience.\u201d\n\nTo grasp why this will take time, consider Edith Brown Weiss\u2019s sobering conclusion that \u201cEarth has become a global commons\u201d knowing that, as Charles Perrings explained, \u201cIf we value things at zero they\u2019ll be wasted.\u201d\n\nAnd consider Joe Stiglitz\u2019s sobering data on the widening gulfs between haves and have-nots.\n\nNavigating these questions can lead one feeling sapped and paralyzed.\n\nBut in these sessions I also saw abundant reason for optimism, empowerment and, most importantly, action.\n\nThere were Gretchen Daily\u2019s many examples of successful efforts to incorporate previously unmeasured values of living resources into decision-making at many levels.\n\nThere was Ram Ramanathan\u2019s extraordinary work grounding atmospheric science in the sooty kitchens of Himalayan villagers.\n\nThen there was Dan Kammen\u2019s description of university students\u2019 efforts to convince boards of trustees that true fiduciary responsibility transcends a strictly financial calculation of a university\u2019s return on investments.\n\nThe most important merit of the growing focus on climate-related divestment, to my mind, is that it prompts us all more deeply to consider the definition of an institution\u2019s \u201cendowment.\u201d Is it stocks and bonds alone or something bigger?\n\nThe work of Partha Dasgupta also puts a spotlight on this question.\n\nFinally, Janice Perlman\u2019s work reveals the vitality and potential in those caught up in humanity\u2019s astounding high-speed reorganization into a mainly urban species and Juan Grabois\u2019s efforts to give a say to those carving an unaccounted living amid that urban rush show that inclusion matters enormously.\n\nMy personal enthusiasm derives mainly from the work of people like Antonio Battro on expanding educational opportunity with a mix of online tools and novel teaching practices.\n\nIn a world with 1 billion teenagers and 1 billion more younger children, you can\u2019t build schools fast enough, or train teachers fast enough, to keep up. And failing to keep up will lead to unemployability, disaffection, turmoil.\n\nAs Professor Battro noted, the key is expanding basic resources like Internet access \u2014 not educational content. In the end, those of us who are professors may be an endangered species. And that can be a good thing, as long as there is equal opportunity for all to become lifelong learners on a planet bathed in information.\n\nAlong with alleviating energy poverty, a prime challenge at this moment should be alleviating \u201cinformation poverty.\u201d\n\nSome factions will fight this, as is the case in Nigeria, where the Boko Haram extremists, whose very name (the translation is \u201cWestern education is a sin\u201d) stands against a basic right, are threatening to sell hundreds of kidnapped schoolgirls into slavery.\n\nBut there\u2019s never been a greater chance, through collaboration and communication, to imbue our varied human journeys with a shared sense of priorities \u2013 including the importance of conserving Earth\u2019s biological bounty, spreading the gifts that come with access to information and safe sources of energy, and limiting the scope of human-driven climate change.\n\nWe are building the \u201cnoosphere,\u201d the \u201cplanetary mind\u201d envisioned in the early 20th century by the Jesuit priest Teilhard de Chardin.\n\nBut it is up to each of us to use this set of tools for good, not just gain.\n\nThis is what the Passionist priest Father Thomas Berry meant when he wrote of \u201cThe Great Work\u201d \u2013 \u201cto carry out the transition from a period of human devastation of the Earth to a period when humans would be present to the planet in a mutually beneficial manner.\u201d\n\nIt says much that even some of the most accomplished scientists at this meeting articulated that progress on climate, energy, equity, education and conservation of living resources will be driven by values and faith more than data and predictive models.\n\nIn a discussion over dinner, Walter Munk, at 96 one of great oceanographers of modern times, spoke not of gigatons of carbon or megawatts of electricity:\n\n\u201cThis requires a miracle of love and unselfishness,\u201d he said.", "image": null, "pub_datetime": "2014-05-08T13:27:54",

"article_html": "<div><p class=\"story-body-text\"> VATICAN CITY &#8212; For four long days, several dozen physical, environmental and social scientists hunkered here with theologians, philosophers, economists and a poverty campaigner to explore ways to balance human ambitions with the planet&#8217;s limits. The rare joint meeting of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences &#8212; &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/accademia/en/events/2014/sustainable.html\">Sustainable Humanity, Sustainable Nature, Our Responsibility</a>&#8221; &#8212; helped demarcate where science leaves off and the rest of society, including organized religion, plays a role in shaping the quality of human life and environmental conditions in this century.</p><p class=\"story-body-text\">A subtext, of course, was that <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/f/francis_i/index.html\">Pope Francis</a>, who made time to meet briefly with the participants for photographs and a short chat, is working on a possible encyclical letter on the environment and sustainable development. (The columnist John L. Allen, Jr., <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/world/2014/05/03/facing-fresh-grilling-vatican-envoy-pushes-back/NcargfrZplpEuC31k2y3hK/story.html\">provides some helpful background in the Boston Globe</a>.)</p><p class=\"story-body-text\">Presentations focused on deepening inequality, the evidence for dangerous climate change, population trends, urban problems, new economic models and more. [There's a problem with the link to the presentations; I'll add it here when it's working.]</p><p class=\"story-body-text\">Although this meeting was planned before Francis was selected, many participants were hoping some of the themes might influence that document, particularly with the United Nations closing in on <a title=\"SDGs\" href=\"http://beyond2015.org/\">a set of Sustainable Development Goals</a> and a fresh effort to <a href=\"http://climate-l.iisd.org/events/unfccc-cop-21/\">negotiate a new climate treaty</a> coming to a head in late 2015. On hand were some remarkable people, including four Nobel laureates.</p><p class=\"story-body-text\">I was invited to present a summary of my impressions as the meeting drew to a close tonight. I found much to be optimistic about. You can <a href=\"http://www.tubechop.com/watch/2789970\">watch my remarks on YouTube</a> or read them below as prepared for the interpreters and participants.</p><p class=\"story-body-text\">For a different take on the climate challenge, watch Naomi Oreskes, the Harvard historian*, describe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXS6X3P0sVU\">her research on scientists as sentinels and her new book</a> of fictional future climate history, &#8220;<a href=\"http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-16954-7/the-collapse-of-western-civilization\">The Collapse of Western Civilization: A View from the Future</a>,&#8221; co-written with Erik M. Conway. [Her section begins at 11:10:50.]</p><p class=\"story-body-text\">Here&#8217;s the text of my remarks, which I titled &#8220;Charting a Sustainable Human Journey &#8211; The Roles of Data, Values, Will and Love&#8221;:<br>\n</p><p class=\"story-body-text\">It was a great honor to be invited to attend this remarkable workshop, and it is a more humbling honor to be invited now to reflect on these remarkable presentations and conversations &#8212; spanning a range of fields from glaciology to psychology and a range of experience from that of a 96-year-old oceanographer to that of a 30-year-old advocate for street workers.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">As a generalist informed by <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/andrew_c_revkin/index.html\">three decades of reporting</a> on the interface of science and society, from the North Pole to the Amazon, I approach this task with the advice of the Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann in mind.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">When faced with complex problems, he has said, the wisest course is to take a &#8220;<a href=\"http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/11/can-better-communication-of-climate-science-cut-climate-risks/\">crude look at the whole</a>.&#8221; That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll attempt to do.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">In convening experts from across the natural and social sciences under the mantle of one of the world&#8217;s great faiths, Chancellor Sorondo and the other organizers have beautifully reflected the realities underpinning our species&#8217; challenge at the dawn of an era of Earth history that is increasingly under our influence.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">That <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/international/21598677-how-modest-canny-man-approaching-complex-task-leading-roman-catholic\">Pope Francis</a> chose to greet us today reflects his passion for harmonizing human relations and our relationship with this living planet. In this focus, the Pope is building on a foundation laid by Saint Francis, who &#8211; as several here have noted &#8211;called creatures and creation kin.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Our predicament in an age some have named for us &#8212; the Anthropocene &#8212; was nicely <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lq1nenatz7m0dap/gQdhrHK591/RODRIGUEZ%20MARADIAGA%20Sustainable%20Humanity-English.doc\">captured by Cardinal &#211;scar Andr&#233;s Rodr&#237;guez Maradiaga</a> on the first day here when he said, &#8220;Nowadays man finds himself to be a technical giant and an ethical child.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Humanity, in essence, is in a race between potency and awareness. The outcome will determine the quality of our species&#8217; journey and will leave an indelible mark, for better or worse, on the planet we inhabit.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">A few years ago, I proposed that we are experiencing &#8220;<a href=\"http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/puberty-on-the-scale-of-a-planet/\">puberty on the scale of a planet</a>.&#8221; Global trends echo that awkward, sometimes damaging, transition from <a href=\"http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/puberty-on-the-scale-of-a-planet/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss\">teenage-style ebullience</a> to the more measured norms of adulthood.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">And just as a teenager resists calls from elders to grow up, societies &#8211; only naturally &#8211; have been initially resistant to scientists&#8217; warnings of irreversible damage to the planet&#8217;s biological patrimony, risks attending unabated climate change and long-distance impacts of consumptive resource appetites.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">In many ways, science has done its job.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The physical and biological sciences, along with revolutionary advances in technology &#8211; from satellites to supercomputers &#8211; have provided a clarifying picture of human-driven environmental changes.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Psychological studies* and surveys have revealed deeply ingrained human traits, many shaped by our evolutionary history as a &#8220;here and now&#8221; species, that prevent us from acting rationally in the face of threats with long time scales, dispersed impacts and inherent complexity.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Possible paths have been delineated in recent decades using ever more sophisticated models.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">But that is where science&#8217;s task ends. It is up to individuals and societies to choose which paths to pursue.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Scientific knowledge reveals options. Values determine choices.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">That is why the Roman Catholic Church &#8212; with its global reach, the ethical framework in its social justice teachings and, as with all great religions, the ability to reach hearts as well as minds &#8212; can play a valuable role in this consequential century.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">This is particularly true for planet-scale problems like human-driven climate change, in which governments tend to put national interests ahead of planet-scale interests.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Decisions at the scale of cities, towns, school boards, corporate boards &#8211; even households &#8211; will, in a cumulative way, be enormously influential and are more apt to be directly shaped by the worldviews and priorities of individuals.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">In a prismatic way, those gathered here have made the compelling case that it is a combination of knowledge, faith, will and love that will determine the quality of the human journey in this consequential and complicated century.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Yes, love. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More on that in a moment.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Of course, as so many of the participants have conveyed, sustaining humanity on a verdant planet is not an either/or choice.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">While data matter enormously, number crunching will not determine the resulting balance.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">While choices are shaped by values, values are shaped by upbringing and experience. That means there is room for positive change, particularly through commerce in ideas and information.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">As Nancy Knowlton explained in the context of the ailing oceans, revealed connections between causes and effects, together with empathy and a menu of solutions, can spark shifts in behavior.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">But the commitment to remain true to a choice and to pursue it through thick and thin requires more than values. It is a function of individual and communal will, as well, as Archbishop Minnerath aptly noted.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The research and ideas presented here revealed another important reality. Given the variegated nature of cultures, worldviews and conditions around the world, it&#8217;s clear that humanity will follow many paths in the decades ahead.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Calls for global and enforceable standards are creditable, but face huge hurdles.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Just consider Stefano Zamagni&#8217;s point about the many different forms of ethics in different countries, or Professor Schellnhuber&#8217;s description of the wickedly complex array of interests and development stages perennially clashing in climate treaty negotiations.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Another reality is that global environmental and social challenges are not the work of a single generation, not problem to fix &#8211; but issues to work on perennially as a normal part of how we live and develop.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">I&#8217;ve written before that what the world needs is an improbable mix of &#8220;<a href=\"http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/urgency-and-patience-required-when-dealing-with-wicked-issues-like-climate-change/\">urgency and patience</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">To grasp why this will take time, consider Edith Brown Weiss&#8217;s sobering conclusion that &#8220;Earth has become a global commons&#8221; knowing that, as Charles Perrings explained, &#8220;If we value things at zero they&#8217;ll be wasted.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">And consider Joe Stiglitz&#8217;s sobering data on the widening gulfs between haves and have-nots.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Navigating these questions can lead one feeling sapped and paralyzed.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">But in these sessions I also saw abundant reason for optimism, empowerment and, most importantly, action.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">There were Gretchen Daily&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.naturalcapitalproject.org/people.html\">many examples</a> of successful efforts to incorporate previously unmeasured values of living resources into decision-making at many levels.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">There was Ram Ramanathan&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www-ramanathan.ucsd.edu/files/SuryaWhitePaper.pdf\">extraordinary work</a> grounding atmospheric science in the sooty kitchens of Himalayan villagers.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Then there was <a href=\"http://e360.yale.edu/E360_Comment_Why_the_Fossil_Fuel_Divestment_Movement_Will_Succeed.msp\">Dan Kammen</a>&#8217;s description of university students&#8217; efforts to convince boards of trustees that true fiduciary responsibility transcends a strictly financial calculation of a university&#8217;s return on investments.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The most important merit of the growing focus on climate-related divestment, to my mind, is that it prompts us all more deeply to consider the definition of an institution&#8217;s &#8220;endowment.&#8221; Is it stocks and bonds alone or something bigger?</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The work of Partha Dasgupta also puts a spotlight on this question.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Finally, <a href=\"http://www.megacitiesproject.org/\">Janice Perlman&#8217;s work</a> reveals the vitality and potential in those caught up in humanity&#8217;s astounding high-speed reorganization into a mainly urban species and <a href=\"http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/accademia/en/events/2013/excluded.pdf\">Juan Grabois&#8217;s</a> efforts to give a say to those carving an unaccounted living amid that urban rush show that inclusion matters enormously.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">My personal enthusiasm derives mainly from the work of people like <a href=\"http://www.casinapioiv.va/content/dam/accademia/pdf/sv125/sv125-battro.pdf\">Antonio Battro</a> on expanding educational opportunity with a mix of online tools and novel teaching practices.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">In a world with 1 billion teenagers and 1 billion more younger children, <a href=\"http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/what-can-u-s-universities-do-about-a-student-stampede-in-johannesburg/\">you can&#8217;t build schools fast enough</a>, or train teachers fast enough, to keep up. And failing to keep up will lead to unemployability, disaffection, turmoil.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">As Professor Battro noted, the key is expanding basic resources like Internet access &#8212; not educational content. In the end, those of us who are professors may be an endangered species. And that can be a good thing, as long as there is equal opportunity for all to become lifelong learners on a planet bathed in information.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Along with alleviating energy poverty, a prime challenge at this moment should be alleviating &#8220;information poverty.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Some factions will fight this, as is the case in Nigeria, where the Boko Haram extremists, whose very name (the translation is &#8220;<a title=\"A pdf\" href=\"http://studies.aljazeera.net/ResourceGallery/media/Documents/2012/2/29/2012229113341793734BOKO%20HARAM%20NIGERIAS%20EXTREMIST%20ISLAMIC%20SECT.pdf\">Western education is a sin</a>&#8221;) stands against a basic right, are threatening to sell hundreds of kidnapped schoolgirls into slavery.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">But there&#8217;s never been a greater chance, through collaboration and communication, to imbue our varied human journeys with a shared sense of priorities &#8211; including the importance of conserving Earth&#8217;s biological bounty, spreading the gifts that come with access to information and safe sources of energy, and limiting the scope of human-driven climate change.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">We are building the &#8220;<a href=\"http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/category/noosphere/\">noosphere</a>,&#8221; the &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.onbeing.org/program/teilhard-de-chardins-planetary-mind-and-our-spiritual-evolution/4965\">planetary mind</a>&#8221; envisioned in the early 20th century by the Jesuit priest Teilhard de Chardin.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">But it is up to each of us to use this set of tools for good, not just gain.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">This is what the Passionist priest Father Thomas Berry meant when he wrote of &#8220;<a href=\"http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/the-great-worker/\">The Great Work</a>&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;to carry out the transition from a period of human devastation of the Earth to a period when humans would be present to the planet in a mutually beneficial manner.&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">It says much that even some of the most accomplished scientists at this meeting articulated that progress on climate, energy, equity, education and conservation of living resources will be driven by values and faith more than data and predictive models.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">In a discussion over dinner, <a href=\"https://scripps.ucsd.edu/news/2045\">Walter Munk</a>, at 96 one of great oceanographers of modern times, spoke not of gigatons of carbon or megawatts of electricity:</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">&#8220;This requires a miracle of love and unselfishness,&#8221; he said.</p></div>", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "movies": [], "updated_dateime": "2014-05-11T02:49:24", "source_id": null}

Dana, a NASA research pilot who flew the X-15 rocket plane at record supersonic speeds and tested many of the most innovative and dangerous aircraft ever developed, died on Tuesday in Phoenix. He was 83.\n\nHis death, from complications of Parkinson\u2019s disease, was announced by NASA.\n\nMr. Dana was a West Point-educated aeronautical engineer and military pilot in 1958 when he became one of the first people hired by the newly created National Aeronautics and Space Administration. As one of 12 pilots selected for the X-15 program, he flew 16 flights from 1965 to 1968 in the bullet-shaped rocket plane, reaching speeds of close to 4,000 miles an hour (about twice as fast as a bullet) and altitudes of 300,000 feet \u2014 nearly 59 miles above ground, where Earth\u2019s last layer of atmosphere meets the edge of outer space.\n\n\u201cThe horizon appeared as a ring of bright blue around the shell of the Earth, with darkness above,\u201d he said in a 2007 NASA interview.\n\nThe X-15 program was created to test the limits of human flight endurance and spacecraft maneuverability. Mr. Dana and his fellow pilots were among the first to test pressurized spacesuits, to study the effects of zero gravity on pilot performance and to test jet controls and other mechanical devices for orienting vehicles in outer space.\n\nThe program\u2019s most important mission was determining whether a rocket with stubby wings could re-enter the atmosphere, turn off its engines and glide to a landing on an airfield as a plane would, rather than being dropped into the ocean for retrieval by ship, as the Gemini and Apollo craft were.\n\nSuch landings, which Mr. Dana and the other pilots accomplished hundreds of times, would make it possible for NASA to begin developing its space shuttle program, sending flights back and forth to manned space stations in orbit.\n\n\u201cPrior to the X-15 flight program, there was considerable reservation about the pilots\u2019 ability to consistently land a power-off, low lift-drag ratio airplane,\u201d Mr. Dana said in a 1998 speech for the Charles A. Lindbergh Memorial Lecture Series at the Smithsonian Institution. But glide-landing the X-15 \u2014 which would be the way shuttles were landed \u2014 \u201cproved easy,\u201d he said.\n\nAll a pilot had to do was start circling at about 50,000 feet, get a good bead on the runway \u201cand descend onto a nominal glideslope.\u201d\n\nMichelle Evans, author of \u201cThe X-15 Rocket Plane,\u201d a history published last year, called Mr. Dana one of the space program\u2019s most important pioneers.\n\n\u201cHe was a very good test pilot, and one of the 12 fastest men in history\u201d at that point, she said.\n\nWilliam Harvey Dana was born in Pasadena, Calif., on Nov. 3, 1930, and raised in Bakersfield, Calif. After earning a master\u2019s degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Southern California, he joined NASA as an aeronautical research engineer at the High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base (now NASA\u2019s Armstrong Flight Research Center) in the Mojave Desert.\n\nHe flew more than 8,000 hours in more than 60 aircraft, including helicopters and wingless experimental rocket planes, during his 48-year career.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Judi; three daughters, Jan Dana, Sidney Sparks and Leslie Kirby; and a son, Matt.", "image": null, "pub_datetime":

He was 83.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">His death, from complications of Parkinson&#8217;s disease, was announced by NASA.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Mr. Dana was a West Point-educated aeronautical engineer and military pilot in 1958 when he became one of the first people hired by the newly created National Aeronautics and Space Administration. As one of 12 pilots selected for the X-15 program, he flew 16 flights from 1965 to 1968 in the bullet-shaped rocket plane, reaching speeds of close to 4,000 miles an hour (about twice as fast as a bullet) and altitudes of 300,000 feet &#8212; nearly 59 miles above ground, where Earth&#8217;s last layer of atmosphere meets the edge of outer space.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;The horizon appeared as a ring of bright blue around the shell of the Earth, with darkness above,&#8221; he said in a <a title=\"The interview.\" href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/improvingflight/rocket_pilot.html\">2007 NASA interview</a>.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The X-15 program was created to test the limits of human flight endurance and spacecraft maneuverability. Mr. Dana and his fellow pilots were among the first to test pressurized spacesuits, to study the effects of zero gravity on pilot performance and to test jet controls and other mechanical devices for orienting vehicles in outer space.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The program&#8217;s most important mission was determining whether a rocket with stubby wings could re-enter the atmosphere, turn off its engines and glide to a landing on an airfield as a plane would, rather than being dropped into the ocean for retrieval by ship, as the Gemini and Apollo craft were.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Such landings, which Mr. Dana and the other pilots accomplished hundreds of times, would make it possible for NASA to begin developing its <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/space_shuttle/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about the space shuttle.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">space shuttle</a> program, sending flights back and forth to manned space stations in orbit.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;Prior to the X-15 flight program, there was considerable reservation about the pilots&#8217; ability to consistently land a power-off, low lift-drag ratio airplane,&#8221; Mr. Dana said in a 1998 speech for the Charles A. Lindbergh Memorial Lecture Series at the Smithsonian Institution. But glide-landing the X-15 &#8212; which would be the way shuttles were landed &#8212; &#8220;proved easy,&#8221; he said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">All a pilot had to do was start circling at about 50,000 feet, get a good bead on the runway &#8220;and descend onto a nominal glideslope.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Michelle Evans, author of &#8220;The X-15 Rocket Plane,&#8221; a history published last year, called Mr. Dana one of the space program&#8217;s most important pioneers.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;He was a very good test pilot, and one of the 12 fastest men in history&#8221; at that point, she said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">William Harvey Dana was born in Pasadena, Calif., on Nov. 3, 1930, and raised in Bakersfield, Calif. After earning a master&#8217;s degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Southern California, he joined NASA as an aeronautical research engineer at the High-Speed Flight Station at Edwards Air Force Base (now NASA&#8217;s Armstrong Flight Research Center) in the Mojave Desert.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">He flew more than 8,000 hours in more than 60 aircraft, including helicopters and wingless experimental rocket planes, during his 48-year career.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">He is survived by his wife, Judi; three daughters, Jan Dana, Sidney Sparks and Leslie Kirby; and a son, Matt.</p>    \n     \n\n                 \n      \n</div>", "meta_favicon": "http://static01.nyt.com/favicon.ico", "movies": [], "updated_dateime": "2014-05-11T02:49:24", "source_id": null}

He finds a den of them only a hundred yards from where a rickety bush plane had set him down on a frozen lake in May.\n\nThe book provoked widespread debate over its sympathetic portrayal of an animal that many Canadians thought should be exterminated. Disney made a film adaptation in 1983 with Brian Dennehy and Charles Martin Smith as a character based on Mr. Mowat.\n\nMr. Mowat was self-effacing about his work. In 1974, in a guide to his papers housed at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, he wrote, \u201cI was content from the first to be a simple saga man, a teller of tales which hopefully had a moral of some sort or another, even if I was confused about exactly what it was.\u201d\n\nHis writing career took off toward the end of the 1940s, after he had served in the Canadian military in Italy during World War II. Joining a relative on a scientific expedition to the Canadian Arctic, he hoped to find an antidote to the dispiriting experience of war. Instead he found widespread poverty and starvation among the Inuit people there, conditions he attributed to abuse and mismanagement by the Canadian government.\n\nThat trip and subsequent ones led to \u201cPeople of the Deer\u201d (1952), a book about the struggles of the Ihalmiut, an Inuit group in the Northwest Territories.\n\nAt a time when the Arctic was largely a distant mystery to the rest of Canada, the book brought Mr. Mowat legions of both admirers and political enemies in the south, where his findings were debated in Parliament. In a review of Mr. Mowat\u2019s follow-up book, \u201cThe Desperate People,\u201d Walter O\u2019Hearn, writing in 1959 in The New York Times, called the author \u201cCanada\u2019s angriest young man.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cNever Cry Wolf,\u201d Mr. Mowat learned about the lives of wolves with binocular clarity, about their treks to find food in winter and their territorial claims in summer, when they remain in their dens living on mice. (Mr. Mowat, in the interests of science, tried living on them, too, and found the diet nourishing.)\n\nHe portrayed wolves as patient and gentle with their own, sometimes even fond of practical jokes. They adopted orphan puppies and babysat for other wolves\u2019 pups. They never killed more than they could eat.\n\nIn one passage, he described the father of the wolf family he was observing, calling him George. \u201cHis dignity was unassailable, yet he was by no means aloof,\u201d he wrote. \u201cConscientious to a fault, thoughtful of others, and affectionate within reasonable bounds, he was the kind of father whose idealized image appears in many wistful books of human family reminiscences.\u201d\n\nGeorge, he added, was \u201cthe kind of father every son longs to acknowledge as his own.\u201d\n\nElizabeth May, the leader of Canada\u2019s Green Party and a longtime friend who had joined Mr. Mowat in environmental campaigns, said that much of the power in his books came from a lack of overt preaching.\n\n\u201cHe was telling stories that made you laugh out loud,\u201d she said, \u201cbut which made you see that the natural world was a big part of who we are.\u201d\n\nMr. Mowat was frequently attacked for his sometimes casual approach to facts, an accusation to which he seemed indifferent.\n\n\u201cI have always been wary of facts, I don\u2019t trust them,\u201d he wrote in the 1974 guide to his papers. \u201cMy experiences in many fields of human activity suggest that they generally conceal, or at least becloud, as much as, or more than, they reveal.\u201d\n\nMr. Mowat had a dim view of the United States, one that did not improve when he was turned away from the border in 1985 under a now-defunct law banning political subversives. In a subsequent book, Mr. Mowat said he had been blacklisted for once telling a newspaper that he had fired his rifle at American bombers carrying nuclear weapons as they flew thousands of feet above Canada.\n\nFarley McGill Mowat was born on May 12, 1921, in Belleville, Ontario, to Angus and Helen Mowat. The family moved several times as his father, a librarian, repeatedly sought work, until they finally settled in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. They had traveled there in distinctive fashion: in a ship\u2019s cabin fastened onto a Model T truck chassis, what they called Rolling Home.\n\nMr. Mowat\u2019s survivors include his wife, Claire, whom he married in 1965, and two sons from a previous marriage.\n\nMs. May said Mr. Mowat had been working on a new book at his death, which came only days before his 93rd birthday. A frequent guest on Canadian television and radio, he had taken time out recently to appear on a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio program to condemn a plan to set up Internet hot spots in several of Canada\u2019s national parks.\n\nCalling it a \u201cdisastrous, quite stupid, idiotic concept,\u201d Mr. Mowat said that parks should be for the preservation of nature.\n\n\u201cHuman beings,\u201d he added, \u201cshould be kept out of them as much as possible.\u201d", "image": null, "pub_datetime": "2014-05-08T04:05:52", "keywords": ["canadas", "north", "champion", "family",

The family moved several times as his father, a librarian, repeatedly sought work, until they finally settled in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. They had traveled there in distinctive fashion: in a ship&#8217;s cabin fastened onto a Model T truck chassis, what they called Rolling Home.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Mr. Mowat&#8217;s survivors include his wife, Claire, whom he married in 1965, and two sons from a previous marriage.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Ms. May said Mr. Mowat had been working on a new book at his death, which came only days before his 93rd birthday.

Friedman, a physicist who specialized in communicating the tenets of science to nonscientists and as the director of the New York Hall of Science in Queens oversaw its growth from a moribund museum to one of the city\u2019s formidable educational institutions, died on Sunday in Manhattan. He was 71.\n\nHis wife, Mickey Friedman, said the cause was pancreatic cancer.\n\nDr. Friedman was an advocate for museums of all types, arguing for their importance and independence. In 1999, he helped lead the opposition to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s threat to cut city financing of the Brooklyn Museum if it mounted the exhibit \u201cSensation,\u201d which featured works the mayor had deemed offensive. Among them was a representation of the Virgin Mary that included a clump of elephant dung.\n\nThe Hall of Science, situated in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in a building erected for the 1964 World\u2019s Fair, had an off-and-on life as a mediocre museum until it closed in 1981. Financing problems and political maneuvering delayed a planned renovation. When Dr. Friedman was hired in 1984 to shepherd the museum to its reopening, he arrived to find an empty shell, the old exhibits removed and an inch of water on the floor.\n\nBut with a new focus on interactive exhibits and education, it opened in 1986 to welcoming reviews and almost instant success. Within two years it featured more than 130 exhibits \u201cranging from microscopes to windmills to the \u2018world\u2019s first three-dimensional dynamic model of an atom,\u2019\u00a0\u201d The New York Times reported.\n\nBy 2006, when Dr. Friedman retired, he had overseen expansion projects totaling more than $100 million, and the full-time staff had expanded to 100. In his final year on the job, the hall recorded nearly 450,000 visitors.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing there, and Alan virtually created the Hall of Science,\u201d Claire Schulman, the former Queens borough president, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cHe made a museum out of the empty building.\u201d\n\nDr. Friedman, who earned a doctorate in physics at Florida State University and also studied literature at the University of California, Berkeley, was known as a lucid explainer who wanted his museum to be the same. He test-drove exhibits, tinkered with them and revised them based on the reactions of visitors.\n\nOne of his legacies is the Science Career Program, which trains high school and college students and puts them to work on the museum floor to explain exhibits to visitors.\n\n\u201cAlan was a showman, and he was also a scholar,\u201d Seth H. Dubin, who was president of the hall\u2019s board in the 1970s and \u201980s, said in an interview on Monday. \u201cIt was one of his goals to encourage as many students as possible to undertake science careers.\u201d\n\nDuring the Brooklyn Museum dispute with Mr. Giuliani, Dr. Friedman was chairman of the Cultural Institutions Group, an organization of more than 30 institutions that receive city money. He cajoled a large majority of his fellow museum directors to sign a letter protesting the mayor\u2019s threat to cut off funding, saying it would have a \u201cchilling\u201d effect on their organizations.\n\nThe city did withhold funding, legal proceedings ensued, and the controversy became an issue in the early days of the 2000 New York senatorial race, in which Hillary Rodham Clinton, who supported the museum, was the Democratic candidate and Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, was expected to run against her.\n\nA federal judge, Nina Gershon, ended the imbroglio, restoring the museum\u2019s funding and barring the mayor from retaliating against it.\n\n\u201cAlan was very bold, very direct and very forceful in his expression of support,\u201d Arnold L. Lehman, then and now the director of the Brooklyn Museum, said in an interview. \u201cHe stood his ground in the name of freedom of expression, and for a while he was almost alone. There weren\u2019t a lot of people who took that high ground.\u201d\n\nAlan Jacob Friedman was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 15, 1942. His father, George, was an insurance salesman; his mother, Eleanor, was a bookkeeper. The family moved to Carrollton, Ga., when Alan was 3 or 4, and then to Atlanta a few years later. He studied physics at Georgia Tech before going to Florida State. He taught at Hiram College in Ohio and received a National Endowment of the Humanities grant to study literature, which he did at Berkeley.\n\nHe subsequently became director of physics and astronomy at the Lawrence Hall of Science at the University of California there and served as a consultant to Cit\u00e9 des Sciences et de l\u2019Industrie, the French national museum of science and industry in Paris.\n\nIn addition to his wife, the former Michaele Thompson, a mystery novelist whom he met at Florida State and married in 1966, Dr. Friedman is survived by a sister, June Entman.\n\nDr. Friedman wrote book reviews and articles for specialty journals on subjects like science education and museum management as well as on scientific themes in novels like Thomas Pynchon\u2019s \u201cGravity\u2019s Rainbow.\u201d He was the co-author, with the literary critic Carol. C. Donley, of \u201cEinstein as Myth and Muse\u201d (1989).", "image": null, "pub_datetime": "2014-05-08T02:45:16", "keywords": ["revived", "museum", "dies", "friedman", "j", "alan", "mayor", "brooklyn", "exhibits", "71", "science", "interview", "dr", "university", "hall", "queens"], "meta_description": "A physicist, Dr. Friedman was an advocate for museums of all types, arguing for their importance and independence and standing up to Mayor Rudolph W.

Friedman, a physicist who specialized in communicating the tenets of science to nonscientists and as the director of the New York Hall of Science in Queens oversaw its growth from a moribund museum to one of the city&#8217;s formidable educational institutions, died on Sunday in Manhattan. He was 71.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">His wife, Mickey Friedman, said the cause was pancreatic cancer.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Dr. Friedman was an advocate for museums of all types, arguing for their importance and independence. In 1999, he helped lead the opposition to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani&#8217;s threat to cut city financing of the Brooklyn Museum if it mounted the exhibit &#8220;Sensation,&#8221; which featured works the mayor had deemed offensive. Among them was a representation of the Virgin Mary that included a clump of elephant dung.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The Hall of Science, situated in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in a building erected for the 1964 World&#8217;s Fair, had an off-and-on life as a mediocre museum until it closed in 1981. Financing problems and political maneuvering delayed a planned renovation. When Dr. Friedman was hired in 1984 to shepherd the museum to its reopening, he arrived to find an empty shell, the old exhibits removed and an inch of water on the floor.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">But with a new focus on interactive exhibits and education, it opened in 1986 to welcoming reviews and almost instant success. Within two years it featured more than 130 exhibits &#8220;ranging from microscopes to windmills to the &#8216;world&#8217;s first three-dimensional dynamic model of an atom,&#8217;&#160;&#8221; The New York Times reported.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">By 2006, when Dr. Friedman retired, he had overseen expansion projects totaling more than $100 million, and the full-time staff had expanded to 100. In his final year on the job, the hall recorded nearly 450,000 visitors.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;There was nothing there, and Alan virtually created the Hall of Science,&#8221; Claire Schulman, the former Queens borough president, said in an interview on Tuesday. &#8220;He made a museum out of the empty building.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Dr. Friedman, who earned a doctorate in physics at Florida State University and also studied literature at the University of California, Berkeley, was known as a lucid explainer who wanted his museum to be the same. He test-drove exhibits, tinkered with them and revised them based on the reactions of visitors.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">One of his legacies is the Science Career Program, which trains high school and college students and puts them to work on the museum floor to explain exhibits to visitors.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;Alan was a showman, and he was also a scholar,&#8221; Seth H. Dubin, who was president of the hall&#8217;s board in the 1970s and &#8217;80s, said in an interview on Monday. &#8220;It was one of his goals to encourage as many students as possible to undertake science careers.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">During the Brooklyn Museum dispute with Mr. Giuliani, Dr. Friedman was chairman of the Cultural Institutions Group, an organization of more than 30 institutions that receive city money.

During high tide one recent afternoon, Eliseo Toussaint looked out the window of his Alton Road laundromat and watched bottle-green saltwater seep from the gutters, fill the street and block the entrance to his front door.\n\n\u201cThis never used to happen,\u201d Mr. Toussaint said. \u201cI\u2019ve owned this place eight years, and now it\u2019s all the time.\u201d\n\nDown the block at an electronics store it is even worse. Jankel Aleman, a salesman, keeps plastic bags and rubber bands handy to wrap around his feet when he trudges from his car to the store through ever-rising waters.\n\nA new scientific report on global warming released this week, the National Climate Assessment, named Miami as one of the cities most vulnerable to severe damage as a result of rising sea levels. Alton Road, a commercial thoroughfare in the heart of stylish South Beach, is getting early ripples of sea level rise caused by global warming \u2014 even as Florida\u2019s politicians, including two possible contenders for the presidency in 2016, are starkly at odds over what to do about it and whether the problem is even real.\n\n\u201cThe theme of the report is that climate change is not a future thing, it\u2019s a \u2018happening-now\u2019 thing,\u201d said Leonard Berry, a contributing author of the new report and director of the Florida Center for Environmental Studies at Florida Atlantic University. \u201cAlton Road is one of the now things.\u201d\n\nSea levels have risen eight inches since 1870, according to the new report, which projects a further rise of one to four feet by the end of the century. Waters around southeast Florida could surge up to two feet by 2060, according to a report by the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Compact. A study by the Florida Department of Transportation concluded that over the next 35 years, rising sea levels will increasingly flood and damage smaller local roads in the Miami area.\n\nThe national climate report found that although rapidly melting Arctic ice is threatening the entire American coastline, Miami is exceptionally vulnerable because of its unique geology. The city is built on top of porous limestone, which is already allowing the rising seas to soak into the city\u2019s foundation, bubble up through pipes and drains, encroach on fresh water supplies and saturate infrastructure. County governments estimate that the damages could rise to billions or even trillions of dollars.\n\nIn and around Miami, local officials are grappling head on with the problem.\n\n\u201cSea level rise is our reality in Miami Beach,\u201d said the city\u2019s mayor, Philip Levine. \u201cWe are past the point of debating the existence of climate change and are now focusing on adapting to current and future threats.\u201d In the face of encroaching saltwater and sunny-day flooding like that on Alton Road, Mr. Levine has supported a $400 million spending project to make the city\u2019s drainage system more resilient in the face of rising tides.\n\nBut while local politicians can take action to shore up their community against the rising tide, they are powerless to stop what scientists say is the heart of the problem: the increasing fossil fuel emissions that continue to warm the planet. Scientists say that the scale of emission reductions necessary to prevent the most dangerous effects of global warming can only come as a result of national and international policies to cut carbon pollution.\n\nIn particular, climate experts say, national policies to tax or regulate carbon pollution are required by the world\u2019s top emitters, chiefly the United States and China. Such efforts have to date met a wave of political opposition in Congress \u2014 bills aimed at putting a price on carbon pollution have repeatedly failed. President Obama plans to use his executive authority to issue a regulation that would cut carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants, but Republicans, who call the rule a \u201cWar on Coal,\u201d want to overturn it.\n\nSenator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, supports carbon-cutting efforts, even as he acknowledges that they will come with some economic cost. In April, he convened a packed hearing at the Miami Beach City Hall on the encroaching waters.\n\n\u201cWith sea level rise, you\u2019ve got to get to core of the problem,\u201d Mr. Nelson said at the hearing. \u201cYou have to lessen the amount of CO2. It\u2019s politically treacherous and costly. But at the end of the day, something like that is going to have to get passed. Otherwise the planet is going to continue to heat up.\u201d\n\nBut three prominent Florida Republicans \u2014 Senator Marco Rubio, former Gov. Jeb Bush and the current governor, Rick Scott \u2014 declined repeated requests to be interviewed on the subject. Mr. Rubio and Mr. Bush are viewed as potential presidential candidates. Political analysts say the reluctance of the three men to speak publicly on the issue reflects an increasingly difficult political reality for Republicans grappling with the issue of climate change, particularly for the party\u2019s lawmakers from Florida. In acknowledging the problem, politicians must endorse a solution, but the only major policy solutions to climate change \u2014 taxing or regulating the oil, gas and coal industries \u2014 are anathema to the base of the Republican Party. Thus, many Republicans, especially in Florida, appear to be dealing with the issue by keeping silent.\n\n\u201cJeb likes to take positions on hot-button issues, the same with Rubio,\u201d said Joseph E. Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami. \u201cOn immigration they are further mainstream on that than the rest of the G.O.P. But on this, Republicans are dead set against taking action on climate change on the national level. If you have political aspirations, this is not something you should talk about if you want to win a Republican primary.\u201d\n\nOver the past year, Mr. Rubio has signaled his skepticism about the established science that fossil fuel emissions contribute to climate change. When asked in a 2013 Buzzfeed webcast interview if climate change posed a threat to Florida, Mr. Rubio responded: \u201cThe climate is always changing. The question is, is manmade activity what\u2019s contributing most to it?\u201d He added that \u201cI\u2019ve seen reasonable debate on that principle\u201d and \u201cif we unilaterally impose these sorts of things on our economy it would have a devastating impact.\u201d\n\nBut in 2008, while serving in the Florida State Legislature, Mr. Rubio supported a bill directing the State Department of Environmental Protection to develop rules for companies to limit carbon emissions.\n\nAs governor from 1999 to 2007, Mr. Bush pushed several environmental initiatives, particularly efforts to protect Everglades National Park, which scientists say is highly vulnerable to encroaching seawaters. Political scientists say that Mr. Rubio\u2019s shift and Mr. Bush\u2019s current silence on the issue appear to reflect the position of lawmakers who are mulling transitions from the state to the national stage and the realities of satisfying their party\u2019s base in the 2016 primaries.", "image": null, "pub_datetime": "2014-05-08T02:08:46", "keywords": ["climate", "miami", "florida",

During high tide one recent afternoon, Eliseo Toussaint looked out the window of his Alton Road laundromat and watched bottle-green saltwater seep from the gutters, fill the street and block the entrance to his front door.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;This never used to happen,&#8221; Mr. Toussaint said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve owned this place eight years, and now it&#8217;s all the time.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Down the block at an electronics store it is even worse. Jankel Aleman, a salesman, keeps plastic bags and rubber bands handy to wrap around his feet when he trudges from his car to the store through ever-rising waters.</p>     \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-5\">A new scientific report on <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"Recent and archival news about global warming.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">global warming</a> released this week, the <a title=\"Access to the report.\" href=\"http://www.globalchange.gov/ncadac\">National Climate Assessment</a>, named Miami as one of the cities most vulnerable to severe damage as a result of rising sea levels. Alton Road, a commercial thoroughfare in the heart of stylish South Beach, is getting early ripples of sea level rise caused by global warming &#8212; even as Florida&#8217;s politicians, including two possible contenders for the presidency in 2016, are starkly at odds over what to do about it and whether the problem is even real.</p>  \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-9\">&#8220;The theme of the report is that climate change is not a future thing, it&#8217;s a &#8216;happening-now&#8217; thing,&#8221; said Leonard Berry, a contributing author of the new report and director of the Florida Center for Environmental Studies at Florida Atlantic University. &#8220;Alton Road is one of the now things.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Sea levels have risen eight inches since 1870, according to the new report, which projects a further rise of one to four feet by the end of the century. Waters around southeast Florida could surge up to two feet by 2060, according to a <a title=\"The report, in PDF form.\" href=\"http://southeastfloridaclimatecompact.org/pdf/Regional%20Climate%20Action%20Plan%20FINAL%20ADA%20Compliant.pdf\">report by the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Compact</a>. A study by the Florida Department of Transportation concluded that over the next 35 years, rising sea levels will increasingly flood and damage smaller local roads in the Miami area.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-2\">The national climate report found that although rapidly melting Arctic ice is threatening the entire American coastline, Miami is exceptionally vulnerable because of its unique geology. The city is built on top of porous limestone, which is already allowing the rising seas to soak into the city&#8217;s foundation, bubble up through pipes and drains, encroach on fresh water supplies and saturate infrastructure. County governments estimate that the damages could rise to billions or even trillions of dollars.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-6\">In and around Miami, local officials are grappling head on with the problem.</p>  \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-10\">&#8220;Sea level rise is our reality in Miami Beach,&#8221; said the city&#8217;s mayor, Philip Levine. &#8220;We are past the point of debating the existence of climate change and are now focusing on adapting to current and future threats.&#8221; In the face of encroaching saltwater and sunny-day flooding like that on Alton Road, Mr. Levine has supported a $400 million spending project to make the city&#8217;s drainage system more resilient in the face of rising tides.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">But while local politicians can take action to shore up their community against the rising tide, they are powerless to stop what scientists say is the heart of the problem: the increasing fossil fuel emissions that continue to warm the planet. Scientists say that the scale of emission reductions necessary to prevent the most dangerous effects of global warming can only come as a result of national and international policies to cut carbon pollution.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-3\">In particular, climate experts say, national policies to tax or regulate carbon pollution are required by the world&#8217;s top emitters, chiefly the United States and China. Such efforts have to date met a wave of political opposition in Congress &#8212; bills aimed at putting a price on carbon pollution have repeatedly failed. <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" title=\"More articles about Barack Obama\" class=\"meta-per\">President Obama</a> plans to use his executive authority to issue a regulation that would cut carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants, but Republicans, who call the rule a &#8220;War on Coal,&#8221; want to overturn it.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-7\">Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, supports carbon-cutting efforts, even as he acknowledges that they will come with some economic cost. In April, he convened a packed hearing at the Miami Beach City Hall on the encroaching waters.</p>  \n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-4\">&#8220;With sea level rise, you&#8217;ve got to get to core of the problem,&#8221; Mr. Nelson said at the hearing. &#8220;You have to lessen the amount of CO2. It&#8217;s politically treacherous and costly. But at the end of the day, something like that is going to have to get passed. Otherwise the planet is going to continue to heat up.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">But three prominent Florida Republicans &#8212; Senator <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/r/marco_rubio/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" title=\"More articles about Marco Rubio.\" class=\"meta-per\">Marco Rubio</a>, former Gov. <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/jeb_bush/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" title=\"More articles about Jeb Bush.\" class=\"meta-per\">Jeb Bush</a> and the current governor, <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/richard_l_scott/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" title=\"More articles about Richard L Scott.\" class=\"meta-per\">Rick Scott</a> &#8212; declined repeated requests to be interviewed on the subject. Mr. Rubio and Mr. Bush are viewed as potential presidential candidates. Political analysts say the reluctance of the three men to speak publicly on the issue reflects an increasingly difficult political reality for Republicans grappling with the issue of climate change, particularly for the party&#8217;s lawmakers from Florida. In acknowledging the problem, politicians must endorse a solution, but the only major policy solutions to climate change &#8212; taxing or regulating the oil, gas and coal industries &#8212; are anathema to the base of the Republican Party. Thus, many Republicans, especially in Florida, appear to be dealing with the issue by keeping silent.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#8220;Jeb likes to take positions on hot-button issues, the same with Rubio,&#8221; said Joseph E. Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami. &#8220;On immigration they are further mainstream on that than the rest of the G.O.P. But on this, Republicans are dead set against taking action on climate change on the national level. If you have political aspirations, this is not something you should talk about if you want to win a Republican primary.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-8\">Over the past year, Mr. Rubio has signaled his skepticism about the established science that fossil fuel emissions contribute to climate change. When asked in a 2013 Buzzfeed webcast interview if climate change posed a threat to Florida, Mr. Rubio responded: &#8220;The climate is always changing. The question is, is manmade activity what&#8217;s contributing most to it?&#8221; He added that &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen reasonable debate on that principle&#8221; and &#8220;if we unilaterally impose these sorts of things on our economy it would have a devastating impact.&#8221;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">But in 2008, while serving in the Florida State Legislature, Mr. Rubio supported a bill directing the State Department of Environmental Protection to develop rules for companies to limit carbon emissions.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">As governor from 1999 to 2007, Mr. Bush pushed several environmental initiatives, particularly efforts to protect Everglades National Park, which scientists say is highly vulnerable to encroaching seawaters. Political scientists say that Mr. Rubio&#8217;s shift and Mr. Bush&#8217;s current silence on the issue appear to reflect the position of lawmakers who are mulling transitions from the state to the national stage and the realities of satisfying their party&#8217;s base in the 2016 primaries.</p>    \n     \n\n                 \n      \n</div>", "meta_favicon": "http://static01.nyt.com/favicon.ico", "movies": [], "updated_dateime": "2014-05-11T02:49:24", "source_id": null}
